Welcome to Zeotap CDP, your gateway to a user-friendly Customer Data Platform that streamlines data integration, enriches customer profiles, enables precise segmentation and facilitates personalised marketing across multiple platforms.
This document is designed to provide you the crucial initial steps to get started with Zeotap CDP and gives you a comprehensive overview of Zeotap's capabilities. It also helps you to seamlessly integrate and utilise your data with Zeotap CDP. Whether you are new to data-driven platforms or an experienced user, this document will walk you through the prerequisites steps that are essential before setting up your Zeotap CDP account, the overall workflow of Zeotap CDP and the best practices to be followed while using Zeotap CDP. 

n a nutshell, you first create a source within Zeotap CDP to gather your customer data (like events from your site or app) processed either in batches or real-time. Channel this plethora of data into the Zeotap system in a specific format by mapping your incoming fields to Zeotap Catalogue fields. This forms unified profiles of your customers in the Zeotap system based on the configured ID Strategy. You can then make use of another tool of Zeotap CDP called Segment, to create cohorts of your customers, known as Audiences/segments. Finally, link these Audiences/segments to outbound platforms such as Facebook, Snapchat, Airship, Batch and so on, to achieve your use case using another Zeotap tool named Destinations.

The following are some of the use cases that can be solved using Zeotap CDP:

Unified Customer Profiles: CDP aggregates customer data from various sources to create unified profiles, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of individual customer behaviours and preferences.

Define the granular consent fields
Define the Granular Consent fields for each source along with the following details:

Identify the attributes denoting consent.
Determine the customer's desired consent type.
Define the applicable channels for consent. In cases where the source lacks an explicit consent field, establish a custom consent field and generate a hardcoded or derived enricher. If no specific consent field exists, the platform considers the complete data as consented for all purposes.
Provide sample files
Provide sample files to Zeotap for testing purposes, adhering to best practices and recommendations for various source types.

Finalise the Enrichers to use
Gather a list of required enrichers, such as Date-Time and Currency Transformations. For an exhaustive list of available enricher types within the system, refer here.


Ensure that you prepare the source-specific data dictionary (listing attributes from each source) and a data model (illustrating the relationships between each source and their respective identifiers) before proceeding with the configuration of the ID strategy.

We recommend you to develop an ID Catalogue document to define relationships between identifiers for the ID strategy configuration, including all relevant identifiers within your account's catalogue. Once the ID strategy configuration is finalised, document the corresponding data scenarios and replicate them in the Zeotap CDP interface. Following that, you can set up your ID configuration. For more information about how to configure the ID strategy for your account, refer here.

Information	
By default, we enable the Identify and link using all IDs option, which takes into
account all the ID attributes across sources for resolving or creating user profiles.
Note that this is an irreversible process. Any changes done after source creation
are only applicable to the new data that is ingested.

Once the data mapping is complete, the customer profiles are created and unified
as per the ID strategy active in the accoun

To get started with Zeotap CDP, begin by creating a new source to bring Data to Zeotap CDP. You must also select a source category that align with your specific needs and create the source accordingly.

The following are the various source categories supported in Zeotap CDP:
Website Events: To send data from your websites to Zeotap CDP, The following are the two commonly used methods/files to implement website event tracking:
Web JS, This is a client-side library that can be implemented on websites to track events, page visit information, user logins, user details and any other information relating to the product or services offered on the website. For more information about WebJS source, refer here.
Pixel files, also known as tracking pixels or web beacons, are small, invisible elements embedded within web pages to collect information about user behaviour and interactions. For more information about Pixel files, refer here.
App Events: To collect customer data in mobile applications, we integrate our native Android and iOS SDKs (Software Development Kits). These SDKs track user interactions and capture events within the app. The following are the two native SDKs available in the system:
Android SDK, This is designed to support all Android devices and tablets, including Amazon Fire TV. The SDK simplifies the process of sending data to any tool without having to implement a new API every time. For more information about Android SDK, refer here.
iOS SDK, This supports all iOS devices and tablets. The SDK simplifies the process of sending the data from your iOS app to Zeotap. For more information about iOS SDK, refer here.
Flat Files: To store data collected from external sources, often in formats like CSV or JSON, which can be directly uploaded from the Sources user interface or through other methods like the GCloud Console, GS Utils, or through third-party tools like Cyberduck. The following are the two ways for transferring batch data using Flat Files:
Zeotap Google Cloud Storage, Zeotap supports importing of data collected from other sources or stored outside Collect onto the platform. This data can be in the form of CSV or JSON files. For more information about Zeotap Google Cloud Storage, refer here.
SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol), Sources supports importing of data collected from other sources or stored outside Sources onto the platform. As an organisation, you can use the SFTP source to onboard your data to Zeotap’s SFTP server using one of the different modes of connection that we recommend. For more information about Zeotap SFTP Sources, refer here.
Server to Server: Sources can be registered for server-to-server data transfer under the HTTP API source. The Source details contain the API endpoint and the write_key to be used for sending the data.
Tag Managers: Provides a user-friendly interface that allows marketers and website administrators to add, update, and manage tracking codes without the need for direct involvement from developers or frequent code changes on the website.The following are the two popular tag managers that Zeotap offers:
Adobe Experience Platform Tag Extension, Zeotap provides the Zeotap Collect Tag Extension within the Adobe Experience Platform marketplace to capture events and user identities and enable cookie syncing on the Web. For more information about Adobe Experience Platform Tag Extension, refer here.
Google Tag Manager, The Zeotap Collect Tag is available as a custom template on Google Tag Manager for easy integration. This is a JavaScript tag that captures events and user information as the customers navigate your websites. For more information about Google Tag Manager, refer here.
CRM Data: refers to the comprehensive set of information about customers and their interactions with a business that is stored and managed within the CRM platform. The following are the CRM Data Source integrations that Zeotap offers:
Salesforce CRM,The Sources module supports importing data from the Salesforce CRM. Salesforce CRM stores data as standard objects that are like tables. For more information about Salesforce CRM, refer here.
Data Warehouse: A Data Warehouse is a centralised and integrated repository that stores large volumes of structured and unstructured data from various sources.The following are the Data Warehouses integration that Zeotap offers:
Snowflake, Zeotap brings simplicity to your data onboarding process by letting you connect directly to your source data residing in Snowflake through Sources. For more information about Snowflake, refer here.
BigQuery, Zeotap simplifies your data onboarding process by letting you connect directly to your source data residing in BigQuery through Sources. For more information about BigQuery, refer here.
Amazon S3, Zeotap brings simplicity to your data onboarding process by letting you connect directly to your source data residing in Amazon (AWS) S3 through the Sources module of Zeotap CDP. Note that you can configure auto-sync of data between your S3 account and the source created in Zeotap CDP by using the Sync Frequency feature. For more information about BigQuery, refer here. 
Customer Engagement Channels: These are powerful tools that enable businesses to interact with customers across multiple touchpoints, deliver personalised experiences, and collect valuable data on customer preferences, behaviours, and responses. The following are the Customer Engagement Channels Source Integrations that Zeotap offers:
Braze Currents
Batch
Dotdigital
HubSpot Source
Airship Batch
Airship Real-Time Data Streaming
Cleverpush (Batch) Source
Cleverpush (Real-Time) Source
Message Queue: A message queue is like a buffer that receives messages in a specific order and forwards them to the concerned sub-system or application in the same order. Message queues decouple the sender and recipient, allowing them to operate independently and at their own pace. Consumers retrieve messages from the queue when they are ready to process them. They can retrieve and process messages independently and at their own pace, allowing for asynchronous processing.The following are the message Queue integration that Zeotap offers:
Pub/Sub Stream, Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe) Stream is a messaging pattern that allows different applications and services to communicate with each other in real-time. In a Pub/Sub system, messages are published to a central exchange (or “topic”) and subscribed to by various recipients. The recipients receive notifications or data as soon as new messages are published, which makes it an efficient and scalable way to exchange information in real-time. For more information about Pub/Sub Stream, refer here.
Pub/Sub Batch, Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe) Batch upload is a way to efficiently and reliably send multiple messages to Pub/Sub topics in a single request. This feature allows you to save network requests and improve the performance and scalability of your applications. In Pub/Sub Batch upload, you create a batch file containing all the messages you want to send. The batch file can be read as often as necessary, but once it is exhausted, only new messages are sent. Pub/Sub Batch upload is useful for processing large numbers of messages at once in real-time applications, as well as in back-end processes that process data over time. For more information about Pub/Sub Batch, refer here.

Once the source is created, proceed with its implementation. Refer to the step-by-step instructions provided in the Implementation guide tailored to the chosen Source Type. You can download this document from the IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS tab of the source that you created.

This is the stage in which you can standardise the incoming data to a single organisational-level catalogue by mapping and applying the required data transformations. Ensure that your ingested data such as identifiers, traits, consent, events and more are appropriately mapped against the fields available in the Zeotap Catalogue. This ensures the structuring the data flow efficiently. Map the ingested fields to the Catalogue fields by clicking Map to Catalogue under either the CATALOGUE MAPPING or PREVIEW DATA tab.


The following are the important steps that you need to know while performing the Catalogue Mapping:


Mapping Customer and Non-Customer Entity Data: You can map both Customer Data and Non-Customer Entity Data in the Catalogue. For more information about the how to map the Catalogue for Customer data and Non-Customer Entity Data, refer here.
Knowing Zeotap Standard Fields – Zeotap provides a set of standard fields in your catalogue. If you do not find these standard fields in your organisation’s catalogue, you can create custom fields. The process of creating the custom fields happens in an interactive interface wherein you can define your data points, bring them into Zeotap and manage them independently. Using this interface, you can easily edit the existing catalogue field or create a new field. For more information about the standard fields, refer to the relevant below links.
Zeotap Standard Fields
Reserved Catalogue Fields
Add a Catalogue field – While adding a new Catalogue field, search for the desired field you wish to add. If the field is already present in the system, you are prompted to use the existing field and can access the details page. However, if the field does not exist in the system, you have to create a new field as explained in the Add a Catalogue field topic.
Configure Enrichers – After adding the fields, you have to configure the required Enrichers. Enrichers are quick functions available for you to perform data transformations. Zeotap enrichers can be broadly classified as Data Transformation Enrichers and Custom Enrichers.
Map the Consent Purposes - Once you have mapped all the Identifiers, on the same screen, click + ADD MAPPING. If a source has consent data, then select the incoming consent field and map it to the relevant Zeotap consent field. For more information about mapping the consent purposes, refer here.
Map the Marketing Preferences - Capture marketing preferences along with consent to add clarity and assurance to the marketing team while designing the campaign for the right audience. For more information about mapping the Marketing Preferences, refer here.
Review Mapping – In the REVIEW MAPPING screen that appears, you can find warnings along with error logs that provide a description of the issue for incorrectly mapped fields. Once you have corrected these fields, the system automatically refreshes, allowing the warning to disappear. For more information about reviewing the mapping, refer here.
Save Mapping – When you have reviewed all the fields, click CONFIRM AND SAVE.

This step allows you to derive user-level insights by aggregating your users' isolated actions. You can then use this data to create more powerful customer cohorts. As a marketer, you can use calculated attributes to create new attributes for a user by aggregating their event data over a specific time period. For example, 90_day_revenue of a user, 1_week_page_views to check the engagement of a user, units_purchased by a user for a specific category like T-shirts. These calculated attributes are used as segmenting criteria and can then be forwarded to different integrations. For example, in a workflow, you can define High Spenders as users with 90_day_revenue > €500 or Low Engagement Users by putting 1_week_page_views < 5 criteria. For more information about Calculated Attributes, refer here.

 The following are the steps involved in creation of Audiences in Zeotap CDP:

Create Audience: Upon successfully creating a source and ingesting your data into the Zeotap system, the next step involves unifying this data by mapping it to the corresponding fields on the Catalogue. Subsequently, you can proceed to create a cohort of customers, commonly referred to as Audience as per your use case.

Define Criteria for Your Audience: Further, define the criteria for the created Audience to qualify customers (unified profiles). You can leverage the available attribute types to define your Audience and create the optimal marketing strategy for them. The attribute types include attributes such as Events, Profile attributes, Calculated attributes, Consent, Marketing preferences and more. To know more about attributes and how to apply them to your Audience, refer here.
Activation is the process of linking the cohort of customers to various advertising platforms, such as Facebook, Adform, Twitter and more. This allows you to implement focused marketing strategies that align with the criteria established for the target cohort.

After defining the audience, you can activate it on a Destination either immediately or you can choose to activate it later. You can revisit this Audience later for further modifications.

To activate the Destination immediately, after defining the criteria for your Audience, on the last screen of the Audience creation, click Activate Now.

This takes you to a new screen, where you can either choose to enable A/B testing on the Audience or activate the created audience by linking it to a specific Destination as shown in the image below.
Set A/B Test – This functionality is exclusively available for users who have opted for it. Selecting this option takes you to a screen where you can split the audience into two or more variations. For more information about AB testing and its application, refer here.
Link to Destination – This functionality helps you to activate the created Audience by linking to a Destination. For step-by-step instructions on how to activate an Audience, refer here.

The following are the best practices for validating data before onboarding:

All sources need to share the sample files to validate the data coming in with the data discovery sheet.
All data should be first uploaded into the sandbox environment and tested, before onboarding onto the Production environment. All clients are given one Sandbox environment. 
The following are the best practices for setting up Organisations and Users within Zeotap CDP:

Data Residency: All data will reside in the European Union (EU) region unless the customer specifically asks for a different region, which needs to be notified before hand.  
If all the data must be unified, then ensure to onboard them onto the same organisation. 
In case of child organisations, data will not be unified across them. This is ideal when:
Data is kept separate across countries or brands.
Consent is specific to a particular brand or source.
User Access Management: Make sure to complete the tree mapping of admin and other roles in the client side.

The following are the best practices and recommendations that must be considered when using Sources:

For information on best practices to be followed while setting up different sources, refer here.
Verify the sample data provided by the customer for nested or complex structures. Presently, this data type is not supported. If ingestion is necessary, the customer must flatten the data on their end.
For Server to Server aka HTTP API sources, the data formats may need to be transformed. 
Consider the Events vs Profiles vs other attribute types carefully when defining custom fields based on the customer's use-case and specified data type. For information on Catalogue fields, refer here.
For Deltas, you must only share the updated data to ensure optimal use of processing allowance.

The following are the best practices and recommendations for setting up Predictive Audience:

Ensure that data for the relevant events is added and accurately mapped.
To run the RFM and CLV models, ensure that the you have mapped Event Name and Event > Timestamp and Event > eCommerce > Price, Order Value or Cart Value in Zeotap Catalogue Field.
The customer should have access to over 10K events for the specific event on which they intend to initiate model creation. For more information about Predictive Audiences, refer here
All the consent and marketing preference attribute should be mapped to relevant consent and marketing preference attributes in the Zeotap catalogue to ensure visibility in Consent Orchestration rules. For more information on Consent Orchestration, refer here.
Below are the best-practices that you need to adhere while setting up Profile API.

As per the Profile API use cases defined in the Discovery Phase, each use case or system must have a separate API key to ensure traceability.
You should invoke the Profile API once per session, only. As the response is unlikely to change, even if the API is called multiple times, you can cache the response locally for subsequent use within the session. However, note that calling the API multiple times is still counted against your usage metrics.
To avoid unnecessary count against your usage metrics,  you can add a check to prevent calling the Profile API when there is no ID to look up.
You can use a separate API token for each interface. This ensures that each interface is uniquely identified and managed separately. Using separate API tokens also enhances the security of your system by limiting access to individual interfaces when one token is compromised.
For user lookups, you can use one of the immutable IDs or primary IDs that you have selected for ID resolution. This ensures that the user is identified uniquely and the lookup is consistent across the different systems.
To ensure security, we do not recommend you implement Profile API on a web interface. Instead, you can implement the API remotely using a service layer. This approach minimises the risk of unauthorised access and other security vulnerabilities that may arise when implementing the API on a web interface.
To call a specific attribute of a user, you can use the Fetch node. This allows you to retrieve only the required attribute instead of calling all user attributes on the client side.

Introduction
Vault is a centralized hub for managing security and other administrative features in Lytics. It provides a single place for Lytics admins to access and change their key security features and user permissions, regardless of product. This means that the controls set in Vault apply to Conductor, Decision Engine, Cloud Connect, and any other products associated with your Lytics account.

Take a quick tour of Lytics Vault.

Navigating Vault
Vault is comprised of the following sections:

Account Usage - an overview of your general account quota usage related to event consumption.
Account Settings - view and change necessary administrative settings and details of your account. These are sectioned into the following categories.
Account Details
JavaScript Tag
Lytics API
Content
Security
Schema
Users - view a list of users accessing your Lytics account, change their details or permissions, remove a user, or invite a new user to the account.
Security
Access Tokens - view and manage a list of Lytics API access tokens. New tokens can be provisioned with specific permissions.
Authorizations - create, edit, view, and delete authorizations within Lytics. Authorizations are credentials to third parties that enable the necessary scopes and permissions for data import and export jobs to run.
Account Setup
JavaScript Tag - learn how to install the Lytics JavaScript tag and validate the installation.
Who can access Vault?
Vault is focused primarily on account admins or those that have permission to administer settings, user access, etc. Based upon these permissions, your experience in Vault may vary, and all sections outlined above may not be available.

📘
If you are unable to access a section please reach out to your account administrator to request those adjusted permissions.

In general, Admins will be able to access all areas. Data Managers, Campaign Managers, Experience Managers, and Goal Managers can access the Authorizations section to manage the credentials for their jobs and experiences. Finally, all Lytics users, regardless of role, should have access to view the JavaScript tag installation page under Account Setup, and they should be able to view their user profile where they can change details such as their Name, Email Address, Phone Number (for two-factor authentication) and change their password. Your user profile will be accessible under the main Lytics navigation under "Manage My Profile."

Notable Changes
For existing customers, slight changes will impact your day-to-day management activities.

Product Switcher
Vault will be available directly from the primary product switcher at the top left of your Lytics interface. This will be your primary access point for account management from now on.

Account Usage
Our account usage data and quota meters received a much-needed facelift. The usage metrics act as the Vault "dashboard" for admin users.

Account Usage Chart

Account Settings
Account setting sections are now accessible through the main navigation. These settings have received a minor facelift update. The form controls for multi-text fields have been slightly updated for a more standard user experience. In addition, users are now prompted to save or discard their changes when navigating away from these pages with unsaved settings.

Users
The user list is now sortable and filterable based on name, email, who invited them, and how long they've been a Lytics user. Each user has a page to view their details and roles. In Vault, in addition to assigning new roles, an administrator can edit any user's name and email address.



The user invite form is now on its page to improve the flow and experience of inviting users. Roles are now sorted into two categories - Admin or Custom Roles. An admin inherently has access to everything, while custom roles give a finer-grain definition of what the user can access. The details on each role are shown in a tooltip when you hover over the role name.



Access Tokens
The access tokens list is now sortable and filterable based on the name, description, the creator of the token, or when/if it has expired. You can now view additional details about the access tokens you've already created, such as the roles assigned, when it was made, and when it will expire. In addition, new access tokens can now be assigned as an admin or with any combination of more granular access roles.



Authorizations
Authorizations are now to be created and updated only in Vault. You will still be able to utilize the auths you create in Vault in other products, but for example, when creating a job in Conductor or Decision Engine, if you don't see an authorization you want to use for that job, you will be linked into the authorizations wizard within Vault to create the auth.

For access to look-a-like models you will need to be an account admin or have a combination of Discovery Insight + a role that gives access to Jobs/Auths.

What tasks can a user of each role perform?
Roles define a set of permissions the user has, which also dictates what actions they can take in the app and through the APIs. Here is a breakdown of the permissions for each role by feature.

Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
To shield PI from users who should not have access, you will need to use the private fields account setting to mark the profile fields you want to hide from anyone who does not have Admin, Data Manager, or User Search roles.

Identity Resolution
Suggest Edits
Introduction
Identity Resolution is a crucial component of customer communication. Establishing and maintaining a well-defined identity resolution strategy is essential, but it can be overwhelming to get started. Several challenges may arise, such as limited and outdated customer data, data silos, technical difficulties, in-flexibility, consistency, compliance, and maintenance.

Lytics offers a solution that powers brands' identity resolution strategies by aggregating data from disparate sources, defining a standardized customer schema, unifying disparate sources, surfacing individual consumer profiles, enabling better understanding, segmentation, and activation across channel tools, ensuring control, visibility, flexibility, security, privacy, and compliance, and maximizing match rates and accuracy across activation channels.

The goal is to construct complex consumer profiles and maintain accurate and compliant user profiles as your brand evolves. Defining the relationship between consumer identifiers is a necessary first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements. To achieve this, we've broken our approach into three components:



Our Approach
Define: Relationships Between Identifiers


Profile definition is the first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements.

To build a strong identity resolution strategy, three key questions must be answered:

How important is accuracy?
How do you define and manage the strength of each identifier to ensure profiles are materialized properly?
How can the materialized profiles be analyzed and delivered to other tools?
Construct: Complex Profiles


Data is messy. Lytics' Profile Materialization provides a necessary cleansing & polishing layer atop the defined resolution strategy. This ensures what is surfaced is accurate and accessible and enables your team to accelerate impact.

Answering the following two key questions guarantee profiles represent the ideal marketable entity:

What attributes should be surfaced on profiles for segmentation, and does the data need to be normalized at all?
What rules should be used to maintain profile integrity?
Maintain: Accurate & Compliant Profiles


Over time profiles will bloat, attributes will become stale, and use cases become more complex. If unmanaged, a quality identity strategy will begin breaking down the moment it is implemented.

Lytics prevents your identity strategy from breakdown through a set of powerful tools focused on ensuring the following profile health-related questions have concrete answers:

How can you validate the health of your ID resolution strategy over time?
What is the process for managing consent?
How long is a profile relevant if it no longer has a means of being updated?
What is the life expectancy of expirable IDs, such as browser cookies?
Advanced Concepts
The Lytics Identity Graph
Behind each Lytics profile is an identity graph. This graph represents connections between pieces of data observed across multiple sources or even within a single source.

To create (or update) profiles from a data stream, the stream must contain one or more identity keys that identify distinct users with which to associate the data. When data is observed for a given identity key, it stores the relevant profile metadata in an object called an identity fragment. When there's evidence on a data stream that two keys or fragments should be connected

When evidence on a data stream shows that two keys or fragments identify the same real-world entity, those fragments become connected in the same identity graph. Some identity graphs are significant and represent complex relationships in the data. In contrast, other identity graphs are small and describe a small interaction, like an anonymous cookie from a single-visit, incognito browser.



Graph Mechanics
As you learned from the identity resolution overview, a profile comprises one or more identity fragments. Many profiles start as singletons – new data is observed on a data stream. That event's identifier keys create any necessary identity fragments and store the event's associated data on that fragment.

However, we're not satisfied with several singletons – our objective is to stitch data sources together by linking the appropriate underlying fragments. Stitching occurs when we observe two identifiers in a single event. A common stitching event is a newsletter signup, where the email address from the newsletter form is linked to the cookie from their web activity and creates a link between activity from the browser on the device and any activity associated with the email address, which could eventually encompass purchases, support tickets, CRM data, etc.

In graph terms, stitching creates an edge between two nodes representing two identity fragments. If we wanted to retrieve a profile associated with an email address, we would retrieve all of the fragments with edges or connections to other fragments. From there, we'd want to find all of the connections to those other fragments, and so on, until there are no more connections to follow. Following one fragment to another is called traversal. The full set of fragments that are found to have connections to the initial fragment are called neighbors.

In Lytics, default graph limits cap the number of traversals allowed for an individual profile at 50 and cap the number of neighbors allowed at 50. Changing these values can create different sets of user profiles over the same data set and should not be adjusted lightly. To change these values for your data, please contact Lytics support.

Identity Keys
As we traverse identity graphs, we'll quickly find that identity fragments and their corresponding identity keys are not all created equal. An identifier's strength must contribute proportionally to its influence on identity resolution.

For example, you have email addresses and cookies as identity keys. Generally, a user identified with an email address can have multiple cookie values (from different devices, browsers, periods, etc.). Imagine hosting a promotional, in-person event and having multiple tablets collecting participants' email addresses. Depending on how those email addresses are collected (most likely through an online form), you'll likely have one cookie associated with many email addresses.



Field Types
Field types for Identity Keys can be either a string or a string set. String sets are a common field type for cookies since one profile is expected to have many cookie values over time. Email addresses are not so cut-and-dry. Some organizations will constrain profiles to have one email address, while others will allow profiles to have multiple (personal, work, etc.). In our example of email collection via physical tablet, if the email address is a single-valued string type, we won't end up with an over-merged hairball.

Using an identity key that allows for a set of values is usually a good idea to have a sensical capacity cap on the field type. A set of cookies, for example, might have a capacity limit of 50 values. On the other hand, a set of emails might have a capacity limit of 5 values.

Identity Key Rankings
The ranking of your identity keys should reflect their reliability and their relative importance in the strategy. In the event of a conflict in stitching and merging, higher-ranked identity keys will win. Typically, most Lytics users configure email identifiers to be ranked higher than cookie identifiers.

Imagine a scenario where email A is connected to cookies X and Y, while email B is connected to cookie Z. If new data is observed that connects email B with cookie Y, we have a conflict, meaning that a resulting stitching between the two fragments would yield a profile with two different email fragments and violates our merge rules.

Merge Conflict

The ranks of identity keys would dictate that, for the new event, the email address it contains is of a higher priority than the cookie value that it contains and would consequently update the profile for Email A and not the profile for Email B.

Graph Compaction
We mentioned that a critical tenet of bulletproof identity resolution is that profile complexity remains stable over time. That is, we need a way to ensure that a relatively greedy algorithm doesn't result in profiles becoming more fragile and susceptible to conflicts.

In Lytics, that is accomplished via graph compaction, a process by which data from multiple fragments is combined into a single fragment. Doing so allows well-established relationships in the graph to be solidified while making room for new relationships within the profile. It functions more as a type of profile housekeeping to keep profile fragments tidy.

Compaction in identity graphs can take on a few forms.

Rank-based Compaction
Let's go back to our example with Email A and Email B. The point of identity resolution within a customer data platform is to enable long and rich relationships with customers. The longer that Email A and Email B represent profiles in the platform, the more cookies with which they'll eventually become connected. Each identity key's ranking allows an identity graph to compact by size or time.

Size compaction: Identity key sets can be compacted after they reach a configurable size. If size compaction is enabled to compact a set after 30 values, then the data from the oldest 30 fragments would be combined into a single fragment and would be further compacted with new data as new values are observed.
Time compaction: These sets would be compacted after a configurable time threshold. If time compaction is enabled to compact a set after 14 days, then the data from fragments older than 14 days would be compacted into a single fragment.
Complying with the Digital Markets Act (DMA)
Suggest Edits
Starting in early 2024, Lytics has updated connections with certain providers to help you comply with the Digital Markets Act's EU user consent policies.

Google Ads Customer Match
When setting up an export to Google Ads Customer Match, there are two dropdowns where you can set the given consent for the audience being exported: Ad User Data Consent and Personalization Data Consent.

For Ad User Data Consent, there are three separate options. Setting to Granted notifies Google Ads that everyone in the audience has provided consent to send user data to Google for advertising purposes.


For Personalization Consent there are the same three options. Setting to Granted notifies Google Ads that everyone in the audience has provided consent for personalized advertising.


For more about these two fields and how they are interrpruted by Google Ads, visit their FAQs.

Find the complete docs on the setting up a Google Ads Customer Match export here.

Google DV360
When setting up an audience export to Google DV360, you must check the User Consent Confirmed checkbox to confirm that you have collected all required consent for the exported audience.


If you have an ongoing audience export to Google DV360, those that haven't confirmed that user consent was granted will go into a failed state. For these jobs, if in fact you have confirmed consent, then you can edit the job, check the User Consent Confirmed checkbox and hit Complete. Once saved, you can select to retry the job and the export will update DV360 list with the consent confirmation, fulfilling the user consent requirements.

Learn more about Google's User Consent policy here.

Find the complete docs on setting up a Google DV360 audience export here.

Amazon DSP
Amazon DSP takes a different approach than Google in helping you comply with DMA requirements. When setting up export of cookies or emails to Amazon DSP, you will be asked to select all the countries where the user info was collected in the Country Codes input.


Amazon DSP uses the source countries of your audience to prevent DMA requirements from being applied to out-of-scope countries such as UK, IN, US, JP etc.

Amazon will treat any audience without a country code as in-scope for DMA. Please note that if no country codes are selected, your export is likely to report a 0% match rate.

If you have an ongoing audience export to Amazon DSP, you can edit the job in Lytics, select the country codes that apply, and hit Complete. Lytics will then update the audience definition in Amazon DSP.

Find the complete docs on setting up an Amazon DSP audience export here.

LinkedIn
LinkedIn made changes for members in the EEA and Switzerland to comply with the new requirements imposed by the DMA. This may affect targetable audience sizes in LinkedIn, however in Lytics, there are no changes to the workflow of exporting users to LinkedIn.

Client & Server Side Cookies
Everything you wanted to know about cookies from client side to server side.

Suggest Edits
What is a Cookie
An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests. Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if two requests come from the same browser—keeping a user logged in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.

Cookie Flavors
First-party
First-party cookies are created by the host domain – the domain the user is visiting. These cookies are generally considered good; they help provide a better user experience and keep the session open. This means the browser can remember key information, such as items you add to shopping carts, username, and language preferences.

Third-party
Third-party cookies are those created by domains other than the one the user is visiting at the time and are mainly used for tracking and online-advertising purposes. They also allow website owners to provide certain services, such as live chats.

Common Cookie Use Cases
Session management
Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember.

Personalization
User preferences, themes, and other settings.

Tracking
Recording and analyzing user behavior.

How does Lytics use cookies?
Cookies are one of the preferred methods for maintaining a user identifier in the browser, both known and anonymous. This gets associated with all inbound events captured by our Javascript tag as they interact with customer websites. Specifically, our Javascript tag stores a string of digits and characters that are used as a unique ID commonly referred to as our _uid or, in some cases seerid as a first-party cookie.

Creating & Managing Cookies
Where do cookies come from?
Client-Side
In web development, the client-side refers to everything in a web application displayed on the client (end-user device). This includes what the user sees, such as text, images, and the rest of the UI, along with any actions an application performs within the user's browser.

When someone refers to a “client-side cookie,” they are generally referring to a cookie that is created and/or managed via a common client-side programming language such as Javascript.

Server Side
Like with client-side, server-side means everything that happens on the server instead of on the client. In the past, nearly all business logic ran on the server-side, including rendering dynamic webpages, interacting with databases, identity authentication, and push notifications.

When someone refers to a “server-side cookie,” they are generally referring to a cookie that is created and managed using one of the many common server-side programming languages such as NodeJS, PHP, Python, etc.

Cookie Ingredients
Name
Defines the cookie name. Generally, the cookie name is the primary way of retrieving a cookie and its associated value and attributes.

Value
The stored value for the cookie. This can include any US-ASCII character excluding a control character, whitespace, double quotes, comma, semicolon, and backslash.

Expires
Indicates the maximum lifetime of the cookie as an HTTP-date timestamp. See Date for the required formatting.

Max-Age
Indicates the number of seconds until the cookie expires. A zero or negative number will expire the cookie immediately.

Domain
Defines the host to which the cookie will be sent.

Path
Indicates the path that must exist in the requested URL for the browser to send the Cookie header.

Secure
This indicates that the cookie is sent to the server only when a request is made with the HTTPS: scheme (except on localhost) and, therefore, is more resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks.

HttpOnly
Forbids JavaScript from accessing the cookie, for example, through the Document.cookie property. Note that a cookie created with HttpOnly will still be sent with JavaScript-initiated requests, for example, when calling XMLHttpRequest.send() or fetch(). This mitigates attacks against cross-site scripting (XSS).

SameSite
Controls whether or not a cookie is sent with cross-origin requests, providing some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks (CSRF).

Who’s taking away my cookies?!?
In June 2017, Apple introduced a new privacy feature called Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP). This same feature was officially released in September 2017 with Safari 12 and iOS 11. Since then, the ITP has evolved and introduced several subsequent versions leading us to the current state (as of July 2022), which has many impacts on marketing but most notably:

ITP blocks all third-party cookies by default. (ITP 1.0/1.1)
ITP can grant exceptions to third-party cookies with Storage API. (ITP 2.0)
ITP caps all first-party cookies set with JavaScript to 7 days or 24 hours. (ITP 2.1/2.2)
ITP caps first-party cookies set by the server using CNAME cloaking to 7 days. (ITP 2.3)
As a result of the privacy and security efforts in general other browsers such as Mozilla’s Firefox(ETP) and Google Chrome have followed suit in announcing and/or implementing their security and tracking protocols, which continue to impact tools such as third and first-party cookies that have long been a staple in providing the data necessary for marketers to personalize their communications effectively.

What can I do to replace my cookies?
With each iteration on more stringent privacy-related changes comes a wave of workarounds or alternate approaches to maintaining access to behavioral data essential to marketing:

1. Deploy a strong first-party identification strategy.
There is no replacement then a strong identification strategy. Creating a relationship in which a user will openly share their identity through a login or some other authenticated means will always result in the highest level of certainty on identity, which leads to the best level of personalization. However, many use cases focus on anonymous users or users who have not built up the relationship necessary to unlock this level of authentication.

2. First-party client-side cookies have changed but are still a viable solution.
Though third-party cookies are effectively dead, first-party cookies are still viable for many use cases. Not only do they offer a very simple off-the-shelf type of implementation for leveraging, they also have a long shelf life, assuming that an anonymous user interacts frequently enough to overcome the 7-day expiration window.

3. First-party server-side cookies offer an extended expiration window.
Over the past 12 months, there has been a surge of interest in server-side cookies. This method for setting cookies currently is not affected by the ITP changes that impact client-side cookies, most notably the automatic expiration at seven days. Rather, server-side cookies can live for long periods, leading to a higher quality identification for anonymous users. The downside, however, is they are far more difficult to leverage than the client-side. They require a much more technical integration with whatever server-side technology is used to power the web asset and may not be accessible in the same manner as client-side cookies.

Getting Technical with Server Side Cookies
In general, regardless of the specific attribute settings used when leveraging server-side cookies, they currently are not impacted by the 7-day expiration window that client-side cookies fall victim to. However, Apple has made it clear that they have additional plans to extend some of the client-side cookie limitations to the server-side, and the most important attribute in that discussion is the HttpOnly attribute.

https://webkit.org/blog/9521/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-3/

As a CDP and technology leader, we always aim to help our customers future-proof their implementations. As such, even though a non-HttpOnly server-side cookie offers an easier means to bypass current client-side restrictions, it is our recommendation to consider investing to leverage HttpOnly cookies set by the server-side to prevent any potential impacts of the next few iterations of ITP. Below we’ll explore the two options and demonstrate the key differences.

Server Side Cookie without HttpOnly
The following example in Node.js demonstrates a sample snippet for setting the cookie server side. Most server-side languages have existing methods to make this very easy. In the case of creating a cookie for Lytics to leverage, you will also need to generate a unique ID which can be done in a variety of ways. In the case of Node, you may consider using the randomUUID() method of the Crypto interface. A simple Google search can lead you or your developer down the road of generating a unique ID that best fits your use case.

Once you have that unique ID, you simply set the cookie using the pre-defined Lytics name our Javascript tag is looking for. Alternatively, the tag can be configured to use any custom name.


// THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS A UNTESTED AND NON-PRODUCTION LEVEL
// EXAMPLE OF HOW TO SET A COOKIE SERVER SIDE WITH NODE.JS AND
// ACCESS THE DOCUMENT.COOKIES FROM THE CLIENT SIDE

var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
var crypto = require('crypto');
var dayjs = require('dayjs');

// cookieParser middleware
app.use(cookieParser());

// route for setting the cookies
app.get('/setcookie', function (req, res) {
  // setting a server side cookie without httponly
  res.cookie("seerid", crypto.randomUUID(), {
    httpOnly: false,
    expires: dayjs().add(30, "days").toDate(),
  });

  res.send(`<html><body><p>A server side cookie has been set.</p></body></html>`);
})

// Route for getting all the cookies
app.get('/getcookie', function (req, res) {
    res.send(` <html>     <head>  <script>      alert(document.cookie);  </script>     </head>     <body>  <p>This is an example of how to get the cookies client side.</p>     </body> </html>`
    );
})

app.listen(3000, (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('server running on port 3000');
});
Since non-HttpOnly cookies are accessible out of the box client-side there is no additional lift necessary. Our tag will pick up the cookie and use that ID as the identifier. It is important to note that any UID changes must also be managed server-side as setting the cookie client-side will engage the 7-day expiration max. In this example, we simply raise an alert with the cookie string and do not show the actual implementation of the Lytics tag.

Server Side Cookie with HttpOnly
Setting HttpOnly to true comes with an additional level of complexity but benefits from following the stringent and recommended guidelines of Apple ITP, which in theory will go farther in the way of future-proofing.

Much like the above example, we’ll set a cookie, in this case using Node, in the same way. The only difference here is setting httpOnly to true. This means that the cookie is secure but will no longer be accessible out of the box by Javascript. Rather, you’ll have to implement an alternative method for surfacing that ID to Javascript so that it can be passed to the Lytics Javascript tag and used during collection/resolution.


// THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS A UNTESTED AND NON-PRODUCTION LEVEL
// EXAMPLE OF HOW TO SET A COOKIE SERVER SIDE WITH NODE.JS AND
// ACCESS THE DOCUMENT.COOKIES FROM THE CLIENT SIDE WHEN USING HTTPONLY

var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
var crypto = require('crypto');
var dayjs = require('dayjs');

// cookieParser middleware
app.use(cookieParser());

// route for setting the cookies
app.get('/setcookie', function (req, res) {
  // setting a server side cookie with httponly
  res.cookie("uuid", crypto.randomUUID(), {
    httpOnly: true,
    expires: dayjs().add(30, "days").toDate(),
  });

  res.send(`<html><body><p>A server side cookie has been set using httpOnly.</p></body></html>`);
})

// Route for getting all the cookies
app.get('/getcookie', function (req, res) {
    res.send(` <html>     <head>  <script>      var uuid = '${req.cookies.uuid}';      alert(uuid);  </script>     </head>     <body>  <p>This is an example of how to get the cookies client side when cookie is httpOnly.</p>     </body> </html>`
    );
})

app.listen(3000, (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('server running on port 3000');
});

Content Curation
Content curation on Lytics involves scanning your website and other content to ingest topics and build content affinities. Properly setting up the curation process is key to enabling use cases such as promoting relevant ads and delivering targeted web content.

This document gives an overview of important concepts and considerations to make while curating your content during the early stages of implementation. It will also help determine if any custom content curation should be planned for.

Ensure that any content customization is performed to support your campaign execution and audience building, not for the sake of customization itself.

Overview
Once the Lytics JavaScript tag is installed, Lytics automatically begins crawling the content on your website using Natural Language Processing (NLP) engines. Put simply, this means that:

Lytics will index your content producing a list of all your content. By default, content includes your web pages and images.

Lytics will crawl the content via NLP providers (such as Google NLP or Diffbot, and extract topics associated with that content.

Over time, as users interact with your content, Lytics identifies user content affinity levels for various topics. While this functionality begins working right away without you having to do anything, there are various things to consider to ensure Lytics is bringing in the content you’ll need to execute use cases.

What domains should Lytics scan?
By default, Lytics will scan all content on your domains. You can specify which domains Lytics will scan by adding domains to the "Domain Allowlist", which can be modified by navigating to Account Settings > Content.

If there are only certain sections of your website Lytics should be scanning, you can customize by allowing or blocking specific paths as well. For example, if you have a blog section and other pages won’t be relevant to gauge what users are interested in, you can add the path /blog/ to the list of allowed paths.

You can see which domains have been improved in the domain and path settings on the Content Classification page. Visit the content account settings documentation for detailed instructions on how to add more domains or paths.

Are there any paths that should be avoided?
A website may have sections that should not be scanned for topics such as password reset pages or any pages hidden behind a log-in (e.g. /password-reset/ or /admin/). These paths can be blocked in your Account Settings under Content.

Which NLP service should I be using?
Lytics uses Google NLP which pulls from their knowledge graph/taxonomy. If you determine you're not getting enough topics from your content, Lytics can use Diffbot in addition to Google NLP, which has more loose associations between topics and content. You'll bring in more topics, but may be slightly surprised by what you see!

If your brand is international, you may need to consider which languages are supported by each NLP service. Please consult the provider documentation for a list of languages supported by Google NLP and Diffbot. Another option is to turn NLP completely off and use only custom topics.

For more details on each service Lytics uses, see NLP services.

Backlog
If you aren’t seeing the content you expected to, note it may take some time for Lytics to crawl all of your content. By default, monthly limits exist for scanning new content (see Content Enrichment limits below). If Lytics scans all new content without having reached the limit, Lytics will move on to older content until it is all scanned. Please allow time for this.

Also, consider how far back should Lytics be scanning. For example, it is likely unnecessary to scan content from 2 years ago. If people are no longer interacting with that content, use Account Settings to set a date to start the scan from.

Content Enrichment limits
Lytics will scan and enrich up to 20,000 URLs per month by default. This limit is designed to act as a guard rail to ensure good filter hygiene is in place. Most accounts do not publish close to 20,000 pieces of distinct content per month. If you believe your account is hitting this limit, please check with your Lytics Implementation team. Once confirmed, you can consider the following options:

Are there any domains or content paths that you can block? This will likely be part of the solution. See Are there any paths that should be avoided? above for more information.
Do you need Lytics to increase the limit?
Robot directives
Your domain likely has a robot directive (e.g. domain.com/robots.txt) that provides instructions to crawlers on how to crawl or index your content. Lytics will follow these directives. While typically not an issue, it’s worth turning to your directives when troubleshooting any missing content or information.

Metadata
You may want to build a collection of content based on publish date or author. Consider the following if this is the case:

If you have metadata on your website, is it using OpenGraph? Open Graph tags will populate the following default values in Lytics:
title, image, published_time, description, and lytics:topics. You can check the lytics_content query in your account to check if all the Open Graph tags you need are being picked up.

If you are not using Open Graph, Lytics may not be picking up any meta tags automatically. The quickest way to check that Lytics is bringing is to use our find a document tool to view the data Lytics has for a specific piece of content. Navigate to Content > Find a Document and search for the URL of the piece of content you would like to view.

If you make changes to your content's metadata and would like to preview those changes you can use our manual classification tool located at the bottom of the Content > Classification dashboard. Enter the URL with the updated metadata and click Get Details. Lytics will scan the document and display a preview of the updated metadata. If you are satisfied with the changes click Complete Classification. If not, you can make additional edits and preview again.

Alternatively, you can check by navigating to Content > Collections. Try to build content collections by author or publish date as these are the most commonly used filters. If the content doesn’t come up as expected, you may need to curate your tags.

Custom topics
For many users outside of publishing who may not have rich content, NLP derived topics aren’t enough. To accommodate this, Lytics can add custom topics via the metadata. The easiest way to do this is by adding the lytics:topics meta tag. Read more on providing custom topics.

If you already have topics in your metadata using a different meta tag than the above, it’s possible Lytics may be able to bring those in as well by making a change to your account settings. Speak with your implementation team about this.

Once this setting is changed and content is rescanned, you will be able to build content collections with this topic, and users' affinities will be generated for these new topics.

Total number of topics
In the Lytics UI, you will see a max of 500 topics. Lytics keeps all of your topics, but only the top 500 are surfaced in the UI.

As you block topics, Lytics will backfill to show 500.
You can allow specific topics to ensure that they make the top 500.
If you choose to allow topics, make sure that the topics actually exist - either as custom topics or are being generated by NLP. Case sensitivity is important when adding topics to the allow list. For example, allowing ABBA is different than allowing Abba.

Other content
If you have other content on your site outside of web pages or images (e.g. PDFs) that you’d like to derive topics from and have them generate affinities, Lytics will need to develop a plan to bring those in using our APIs.

Document properties
All topics - NLP derived or custom topics - will allow for two things:

Building a content collection with the topics.
Assign affinities to users for those topics.
There are instances where you may want to build collections based on a topic, but not have them generate affinities. For example, a collection of featured sale items, SKUs, genres, etc. You can set these as document properties in your metadata to allow for this.

Topic Taxonomy
Using data science techniques to look at the topic overlap between classified content, Lytics will programmatically build a topic taxonomy. In addition to programmatically building this taxonomy, Lytics dynamically adjusts the taxonomy as new content gets published.

The topic taxonomy is stored as a weighted and directional graph. Although this structure may be daunting to look at—and even more daunting to try and utilize by hand—Lytics uses it when determining content recommendations.

An example topic taxonomy graph

Topic Relationships
Topics are determined to be related by evaluating how they occur together and how they occur independently. When two topics occur together frequently (meaning in multiple documents), it is safe to assume they are related. In addition to the relationship existing, Lytics will determine the direction of the relationship. Is "Cookies" a subtopic of "Baking" or is "Baking" a subtopic of "Cookies"?

The co-occurrence of topics determines the relationship. The independent occurrence of a topic determines the direction. Since the topic "Cookies" frequently occurs with "Baking," but "Baking" frequently occurs without "Cookies," "Cookies" must be a subtopic of "Cookies." To draw this example further, "Baking" may be a subtopic of "Recipes," "Recipes" may be a subtopic of "Cooking," and "Cooking" may be a subtopic of "Hobbies."

This is important because it allows Lytics to make affinity inferences. A user with a high affinity for "Cookies" may be interested in general "Baking" content.

Weighting Relationships
The weight between relationships is incredibly important to consider when making affinity inferences. For instance, Michael Jordan played baseball professionally for one dark year in the 90s. This means there are valid relationships between Michael Jordan and Baseball and Michael Jordan and Basketball. Most people who know anything about sports or pop culture know Michael Jordan as a basketball icon. The way this gets reflected in taxonomy is through relationship weights. The weight between Michael Jordan and Basketball is strong, while the weight between Michael Jordan and Baseball is weak.

By having weights, affinity inferences can use those weights as thresholds for building further relationships or recommending content. A user who has shown interest in Michael Jordan is more likely to be interested in Basketball than they are to be interested in Baseball. Unless they are interested in Sports Icons From The 90s, they might be more interested in Ken Griffey Jr. A rich topic taxonomy will surface this nuanced information.

The Graph Representation of the Taxonomy
A graph is the ideal data structure for topic taxonomies and taxonomies in general. Since each topic can have many subtopics and be the subtopic of many things, the correct way to structure this data is with a graph.

Leaders in data modeling use this approach. Notable examples are Facebook's Social Graph and Google's Knowledge Graph.

Welcome to the Pipeline & Profiles section, where we will explore data management and analysis fundamentals. This section will delve into the concepts of data streams, data sources, and queries/LQL.

Data Sources refers to the origin of the data and how you can leverage hundreds of different out-of-the-box integrations or APIs to aggregate your data from disparate channels.

Data Streams outline how to control and monitor data that is being streamed into the Lytics platform.

Queries & LQL breaks down our core query language and capabilities for transforming and unifying your data.

Jobs (Data Sources and Exports)
Suggest Edits
Introduction
Consumers engage with your brand across many channels, resulting in vast amounts of rich behavioral data siloed away across various channel tools. Lytics connects to these channels via Jobs to aggregate and unify that data into a comprehensive view of the customer. This enables you to gain deeper insights, create personalized experiences, and drive revenue.

📘
The landscape in which your consumers interact is broad. To ensure Lytics makes it easy to both collect and deliver essential data, insights, and audiences, we have a variety of integration options.

The Basics
Import Jobs are managed by Lytics and are responsible for automating, where applicable, the process of:

Authenticating and managing a connection to an external system.
Gathering data from an external system and ingesting it in Lytics on sensible data streams.
Handling errors and "retry" logic.
Determining the cadence at which the job should run again.
Similarly, Export Jobs are managed by Lytics and are responsible for automating, where applicable, the process of:

Authenticating and managing a connection to an external system.
Gathering data like user attributes, audiences or events from Lytics and exporting it to an external system.
Handling errors and "retry" logic.
Determining the cadence at which the job should run again.
Adding a new Job
New data import Jobs are added from the Conductor interface by first navigating to the Jobs section under the Pipeline section in the main navigation.



From there, you'll click "+ Create New" at the top of the list and enter the wizard to guide you through the creation process.



Configuring a Job
Select a Provider
Each Job is first categorized by the provider, making it easy to narrow down the channel you'd like to integrate with. To select a provider, click the tile representing your desired provider, such as "Google."



Select Job Type
With the provider selected, we'll surface the various ways you can integrate with that particular provider. This will vary significantly by the provider.



Select Authorization Method
Each provider and job type may require additional authorization to finalize the connection. On the "select authorization" step, you can either select an existing authorization or create a new one. When creating a new authorization, you will be asked to provide the required credentials, such as key and secret, to proceed.



Create New Authorization
You can create it during source configuration if you lack valid authorization for your desired provider/source combination. Click "Create new Authorization" above the list, follow the wizard in Vault, and return to where you left off.


Configure Job
The final step lets you provide the specific configuration details for your chosen provider and job type. Again, the options supported by each provider will vary greatly, and provider-specific integration details should be leveraged to determine the optimal approach.



Monitoring a Job
Once you have one or more Source jobs running, they will be accessible from the Source list view, as pictured below. This view provides quick access to essential details:

Name: Name of job, such as "Export of High-Value Users to Facebook."
Authorization: Name of the associated authorization.
Provider: Third-party tool that you are connecting with Lytics.
Type: Indicates whether the job is an import, export, or enrichment.
Status: Current state of a job such as running, paused, completed, etc.
Created: Date the job was initially created.


Job Status
Detailed states are provided to understand better what is happening in the background during a job's lifecycle. These states will vary by job but include:

Job Status	Description
Running	The job is actively running.
Sleeping	The job is not actively running but is scheduled to run again after a given period. A job is sleeping either because the job runs on a periodic cadence with scheduled sleep in between job runs or the job has encountered an error and is sleeping before retrying the request.
Failed	The job has encountered consecutive errors over 10 hours and is removed from running again. Check the logs to see if there are any fixable issues. Failed works can be resumed, which will schedule it to run again. Failed jobs will be automatically purged after 90 days.
Paused	A user has paused the job. The work can be scheduled to run again by resuming the job. Paused works will be automatically purged after 90 days.
Completed	The job has completed all its scheduled tasks and will not be rerun. These will be purged from the job history after 90 days.
For more information on job states or troubleshooting failed jobs, see job processing.

Job Summary
Clicking on any of the items in the Source list will navigate to its dedicated summary view for greater detail. This summary provides all the relevant information about each job you've created in Lytics and an entry point to alter the configuration or status.

At the top of the Job Summary page, you’ll find the following quick-access information:

Status: Indicates the current state of a job. See the table below for descriptions of each status.
Provider: Third-party tool that you are connecting with Lytics, such as Facebook, Google, Mailchimp, etc.
Type: Indicates whether the job is an import, export, or enrichment.
Job Name: Name of the job, such as “Import Users & Activity” or “Export Audiences.”
Authorization: Name of the authorization, such as “Main Salesforce auth.”
Created By: Lytics user who created the authorization.
Last Updated: Date the job was most recently edited.

📘
You can edit the name and description of an existing job from its summary page to improve the organization and clarity of your account's list of jobs.

Metrics
The activity chart will provide metrics (if available) on a job's performance to give a better understanding of how your data is flowing in and out of Lytics. You can see the number of profiles the job added, removed, or omitted during the selected time frame. Note this feature is currently in development. Once metrics are available for each job, this chart will become populated.



Configuration
The configuration section displays a JSON view of your job's current configuration. This includes details such as the authorization used, where data is coming from, which data is being pulled in, etc.



Logs
The Logs section records the history of events for this job, details about the work completed, and the time each job was run. The logs are helpful to ensure your work is running as expected and for troubleshooting if any issues arise. Below are descriptions of the job events you may see in the logs.

Job Events	Description
Started	The job has started running for the first time.
Synced	The job has completed a unit of work successfully and will continue to run.
Error	The job has encountered an error and will retry automatically.
Sleeping	The job is currently sleeping due to external restrictions, such as hitting a provider's API limits.
Failed	The job has encountered consecutive errors over 10 hours and is removed from running again.
Completed	The job has completed all its scheduled tasks and will not be rerun.
Backfilling Data
Some use cases involve having historical data available for segmentation. This data might be demographic in nature, or describe how customers prefer to be contacted. This document offers guidelines for cases where large amounts of this data must be available in your Lytics account.

Best Practices
Separate Backfill from Real-time Streams
A real-time data stream contains messages sent in response to the activity they describe. This is distinguished from batched data streams, where messages are sent in groups on a given schedule or according to another trigger.

For attributes that will be kept updated by a real-time stream, there is the additional requirement to populate that attribute with a substantial amount of pre-existing information, separating that backfilling from now-forward messages.

Backfill messages can be sent using multiple means. API loads should be sent via the bulk CSV or bulk JSON endpoints. It is also possible to use integration workflows to import this data, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3.

The benefit of separating this data from real-time message streams is that the processing of backfill messages does not impact the processing time of messages received from real-time streams. The bulk imports are processed in parallel to real-time messages. This means that marketing activations reliant on real-time updates are not affected.

Utilize Timestamps
Whenever possible, all messages should have an explicit timestamp. While all messages are additionally time stamped by Lytics at the time of ingestion, specifying a message timestamp is helpful in all circumstances, particularly in cases when messages are received out of order so that Lytics knows which one is the most up-to-date. It is essential when a backfill occurs concurrently with a real-time stream of the same attribute.

All means of loading data permit specifying timestamps. Via API, this is via a timestamp_field URL parameter. In the Admin UI, data import configuration options feature a menu to pick among the file schema for a timestamp field.

Evaluate Necessity
All messages imported into your Lytics account are stored in their raw form and represented as profile attributes in the graph. The purpose of storing all messages is to enable the reprocessing of those messages, a process called rebuilding. Rebuilding enables all received messages to be represented differently with different attributes, identity resolution rules, etc.

All data ingested into Lytics incrementally increase the overhead of rebuilding, making it a longer and more processing-intensive operation. Therefore, before importing large amounts of data, consider the value/benefit of that data. If there is no clear use case for backfilling, consider skipping it.

Data Streams
Suggest Edits
Introduction
A data stream is a continuous flow of data generated from various sources such as websites, mobile apps, email providers, social media, and other digital platforms. Data streams typically involve high volumes of data generated in real-time or near-real-time, making it necessary to process and analyze the data as it arrives.

Lytics allows for creating any number of data streams to provide logical distinctions among data sources in either type or scope. For example, data describing email subscriber attributes should exist on a different data stream than one describing email subscriber activity. This ensures maximum flexibility when defining the relationships between sources and how they ultimately are unified into a materialized user profile.

What is an "event?"
In Lytics, an "event" is an action or activity performed by a user or a customer, such as visiting a website, purchasing, or subscribing to a newsletter. As pictured below, events are showcased as independent key/value pairs on a single data stream. These keys are then translated into Fields & Mappings in order to materialize to user profile for segmentation.



Exploring Data Streams
Lytics will ingest data that is sent to one of Lytics' Collection APIs: the collect API or the bulk API. The bulk API is generally intended for larger imports of offline data, while the collect API is generally intended for more real-time sources and usage.

Viewing Your Data Streams
You can view information about your data streams in your Lytics dashboard by navigating to Conductor > Pipeline > Streams. The primary purpose of this section is to verify that data is successfully being received by Lytics. If your account has multiple data streams, you can view a different stream from the dropdown menu above the graph.

Many integrations have multiple streams. For instance, it is common for email integrations to have an activity stream and a user stream. Integration streams should be prefixed to help identify the source. You can find the streams for integration under the documentation for that integration.

📘
The number of keys in a data stream can be extremely large. This is normal and does not impact performance. Any keys that comprise less than 0.1% of the data volume OR have not been seen in 7 days will be hidden from display to reduce clutter.

Event Ingress Graph
The event ingress graph shows the number of events collected on a stream for the selected time period (past day, week, month, 3 months, and year) and interval (hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly). Above the graph, you will find the time the last message from this stream was received, the source of the data stream, and the number of fields in the stream.

📘
Last message received strives for real time reporting but can lag under a number of conditions including during bulk imports. If a data stream is not updating as expected please contact Lytics Support for assistance.



Raw Keys Table
Below the event ingress graph is the raw keys table. An event may contain any number of key-value pairs. Each record in this table represents a unique raw key seen on the stream in at least one event.



The table has the following information on keys:

Column	Description
Name	The name of the key.
Predicted Type	The assumed data type for the value is determined by sampling the values received.
First Seen	The date the key was first seen, according to the date of the event.
Last Seen	The last time a key was seen, according to the date of the event.
Times Seen	The number of events that contained the key.
Unique Values	The number of different values seen.
Times Used	The number of user fields that use the key.
In addition to these seven columns, each record in the table can be clicked to open up a set of sample values. This can be used to verify that values are being collected and they match the expected data.

📘
If a key has many different values, the modal may not display all the values for the chosen key.

The table can be filtered in three ways: used vs. unused, common vs. uncommon, and text search.

Filter	Description
Used	A raw key that is mapped to a user field.
Unused	Raw keys are collected and stored but never mapped to user fields.
Common	Raw keys that have been seen more often on events relative to other raw keys based on the times seen value.
Uncommon	Raw keys are seldom seen on events relative to other raw keys.
Hiding Keys
Raw event keys can be hidden, but it is important to note that keys cannot be made visible again through the user interface - only through the API. It is recommended that a list is kept of hidden keys in the event one needs to be resurfaced at a later date. If you need assistance, please contact Lytics Support with your key name and account ID.

To hide a key:

Select the checkbox next to the name of the key or keys.
Click Remove selected key.
Final Thoughts
Having logically differentiated data streams for different data sources also helps to facilitate a more straightforward process for mapping data from data sources to user profiles. However, integrating data from some data providers can make this distinction difficult. For example, data routers like Segment or Rudderstack can route data from multiple sources into a single destination, like Lytics.
Stream Routing API
Suggest Edits
"WHERE" Clauses --> Route Rules
V2 Conductor Schema does not have a direct analog for WHERE clauses in V1 schema, or LQL. In V1, for example, it was possible to describe a clause to filter data that is mapped for a stream, such as the following, which ignores events whose _url field contains the string localhost:


WHERE     not(contains(`_url`, "localhost"))
To achieve the same result in accounts with Conductor Schema turned on, we need to use the Stream Route Rules API, whose endpoints include the following:

GET /v2/stream/rule retrieves a list of all route rules defined in the account
GET /v2/stream/rule/:id retrieves a single route rule by its ID
POST /v2/stream/rule creates a new route rule
POST/PUT /v2/stream/rule/:id upserts an existing route rule by its ID
DELETE /v2/stream/rule/:id deletes an existing route rule by its ID
Route rules define data to route from one input stream to another output stream. On ingress, the stream on the record is overwritten from input to output if the rule is active and evaluates to true when executed against the incoming record.

The mechanics of this imply one important distinction relative to V1 WHERE clauses: since route rules describe which records to redirect away from the input stream, rather than which records to evaluate for the input stream, they are in effect the inverse of WHERE clauses. If, for example, we want to ignore urls containing the string localhost from our input stream app in the WHERE clause above, we would need to define a route rule containing the following expression (which is the precise inverse of our WHERE clause):


WHERE     contains(`_url`, "localhost")
This tells the system to redirect events matching this expression to a new output stream we define on the route rule object. By convention, if we don't care about mapping records that match our route rule, we call that output stream {input-stream}_divert, and define the following route rule object (note the need to escape double quotes inside the expression so that our object is valid JSON):


{
    "account_id": "4f7b525bdba058fc096757a6",
    "active": true,
    "aid": 12,
    "expression": "contains(`_url`, \"localhost\")",
    "input": "app",
    "name": "Ignore events from localhost",
    "output": "app_divert",
    "priority": 1
}
📘
Note: If there is a use case to take all events and route them to the output stream, the expression can hold the string value of "true" instead of a logic condition. i.e. "expression": "true"

Our object includes several properties which should be self-explanatory: account_id, aid, and name. The rest are as follows:

active defines whether the rule should be activated against incoming data. Marking a rule as "active": false turns it off.
priority indicates the order in which the rules are evaluated (higher priority first) against an event. secondary sorting according the age (newer rules first) is performed when priorities match
📘
Note that because these route rules are cached, it will take up to 10 minutes for any updates you make to take effect.

Example
To create our sample route rule, we make the following call. If successful, the response body will include the full route rule object, including a system-generated ID which can be used for subsequent calls against the object:

Bash

echo '{
    "account_id": "4f7b525bdba058fc096757a6",
    "active": true,
    "aid": 12,
    "expression": "contains(`_url`, \"localhost\")",
    "input": "app",
    "name": "Ignore events from localhost",
    "output": "app_divert",
    "priority": 1
}' | http POST $LIOAPIPROD/v2/stream/rule Authorization:$LIOTOKEN account_id==4f7b525bdba058fc096757a6
Routing Tips and Tricks
Exporting Routed Data
When data is routed from the input stream to the output stream, Lytics will associate the raw routed data to the output stream. This means when a raw activity data is exported, the data that was routed will be associated with the output stream only.

Behavior Scoring on Streams
An optional feature with all streams is to add Behavioral Scoring to selected streams. If a behavioral scores are desired for a specific stream make sure the stream that is being targeted is the routing output stream and not the input stream.

Create an Input
Introduction
The purpose of this guide is to walk you through the basic steps of setting up mParticle in your app, unlocking core functionality, and troubleshooting common issues. Along the way, you’ll cover some important concepts you need to understand to be successful with mParticle.

This is not a complete guide to all of mParticle’s features and capabilities. If you already know your way around mParticle and you’re looking for in-depth docs, head to our Developers or Guides sections.

Most of this guide is aimed at users of the mParticle Dashboard, but to follow along with the tutorials, you will need to set up the mParticle SDK in your iOS, Android or web app, so you may need support from a developer to complete some steps.
Examples
The tutorials in this guide follow the process of setting up mParticle in the mPTravel app: a mobile and web app that sells luxury travel packages to its users.

Later on in this guide, you’ll learn about sending data from mParticle to some of our many integration partners. As examples, the tutorials use services which are simple to set up and verify, and which offer a free account tier, so that you will be able follow the examples exactly if you wish. However, mParticle is agnostic about which integrations you choose and you can follow the same basic steps from this guide to implement any of our integrations.

Inputs and Outputs
One of the key functions of mParticle is to receive your data from wherever it originates, and send it wherever it needs to go. The sources of your data are inputs and the service or app where it is forwarded are outputs. A connection is a combination of an input and output.

Inputs include:

Apps or services built on any platform we support, such as iOS, Android, or Web. You can view the full list in SETUP > Inputs in the PLATFORMS tab.
Data feeds of any other data you want to send into mParticle. This could be data you have collected yourself or from a feed partner. Once configured, feed inputs are listed in SETUP > Inputs on the FEEDS tab.
Outputs may be configured for events, audiences, cookie syncs, or data subject requests depending on what the output supports. You can see the list of configured outputs in SETUP > Outputs or SETUP > Data Warehouses. Outputs include:
Analytics partners such as Indicative
Advertising partners such as Facebook
In-app messaging partners such as Braze
Data Warehouse partners, such as Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake
To get started with mParticle, you need some data, which means you need to create at least one input.

Create Access Credentials
The first thing you need to do is to to create a set of access credentials that will allow a client-side SDK or a server-side application to forward data to this workspace.

Login to your mParticle account. If you’re just getting started, your first workspace is created for you. The first screen you see is an overview of activity in the workspace. Since you haven’t yet sent any data, there’s nothing to report, so far. 
Navigate to Setup > Inputs in the left column. Here you can see each platform type accepted by mParticle. Different platforms are associated with different sets of metadata, such as device identifiers, and most outputs only accept data from a limited set of platforms, so it is important to select the right platform. To capture data from your native Android app, choose Android. Just click the + next to your chosen platform. 
Click Issue Keys.

Copy and save the generated Key and Secret. 
About Access Credentials
mParticle labels the credentials you create for an integration the key and secret, but they are not exactly like an API key and secret, since you embed these credentials in the app. However, this is not the security risk that exposing API credentials would be:

The client-side key and secret can’t read data from the system.
You can block bad data to stop any traffic that doesn’t match the data you expect as defined in your schema.
Most anonymous client-server architectures, including Adobe, Braze, Firebase, Google Analytics, and Segment don’t have per-session or per-instance credentials, nor does mParticle.

Install and Initialize an mParticle SDK
You need a developer to help you install and initialize an SDK. See the Getting Started guides for the iOS, Android or Javascript SDKs to get set up before continuing.

Verify: Look for Incoming Data in the Live Stream
Navigate to Activity > Live Stream in the left column. The Live Stream lets you inspect all incoming data from your development environments. It’s an easy way to check that you have correctly initialized mParticle in your app. When you first open up the Live Stream, it will be empty, as we haven’t yet started sending data. 
Start up a development build of your app (get a developer to help you if necessary). The mParticle SDKs automatically collect and forward data about installs and user sessions, so just by opening a development build of your app, you should start to see data in the Live Stream. 
Advanced Platform Configuration Settings
For the iOS, Android, tvOS, and Web platforms, some advanced configuration settings are available. To change these settings, navigate to Setup > Inputs in the left column and select either iOS, Android, tvOS, or Web from the list of platforms.

Expand the Advanced Settings by clicking the + icon.

Restrict Device ID by Limit Ad Tracking
iOS, Android, and tvOS (Apple TV) devices allow users to limit the collection of advertising IDs. Advertising IDs are unique identifiers you may use to associate event and user data with a specific device. For both iOS and Android devices, if a user has not provided explicit consent to share their device’s advertising ID, then the value of that ID is set to an all-zero value.

By checking Restrict Device ID by Limit Ad Tracking, mParticle will not collect advertising IDs from users who have enabled the Limit Ad Tracking setting on their device.

Remember, mParticle will collect advertising IDs for both iOS and Android devices, regardless of whether or not a user has enabled the Limit Ad Tracking setting on their device. However, the IDs collected from users who have opted out will be all-zero values.

Following are descriptions of Apple and Google’s policies for device advertising IDs:

iOS Advertising IDs
After the release of iOS 14.5, Apple introduced the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, which requires app developers to request users’ explicit consent to share their advertising IDs. If a user of your app has not provided this consent, Apple’s advertising ID (IDFA) will be set to all an all-zero value: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000. Read more about Apple advertising identifiers in their documentation.

For more information about the ATT framework, visit the iOS 14 Guide.

Android Advertising IDs
Google allows Android users to opt out from sharing their devices’ advertising IDs. Similar to Apple’s policy, Google will set a user’s advertising ID (GAID or AAID) to an all-zero value if that user has opted out from sharing their ID. Read more about Google’s advertising identifiers in their documentation.

Collect Integration-Specific Identifiers
The Web SDK can collect integration-specific identifiers to enrich the user data forwarded to your connected outputs.

When Collect Integration-Specific Identifiers is checked, these integration-specific identifiers are collected and used to enrich your user data to help optimize the match rate of your audiences in downstream tools. Currently, these identifiers include Facebook’s fbc and fbp fields.

Supported Integrations
Vendor	Identifier	Collection Method	Maps to
Facebook Click ID	fbclid	url query parameter	Facebook.ClickId
Facebook Click ID	fbc	browser cookie	Facebook.ClickId
Facebook Browser ID	fbp	browser cookie	Facebook.BrowserId
Google GCLID	gclid	url query parameter	GoogleEnhancedConversions.Gclid
Google GWBRAID	gwbraid	url query parameter	GoogleEnhancedConversions.Gbraid
Google WBRAID	wbraid	url query parameter	GoogleEnhancedConversions.Wbraid
Troubleshoot
If you don’t see data appearing in the Live Stream within the first few minutes after opening a development build:

Check that you have copied your Key and Secret correctly
Check that you have properly included the mParticle SDK in your project and it is correctly initialized. The necessary steps will differ depending on the platform. Check our iOS, Android and Web docs for more.
Next Steps
Congratulations, you have created a working data input. Now it’s time to start capturing some data.

After you create an input, you can begin capturing data.

Prerequisites
Before you start this activity, you should have already:

Created an input.
Data in mParticle
mParticle collects two important kinds of data:

Event data
Event data is about actions taken by a user in your app. Some events are collected automatically by mParticle’s native SDKs. These include the Session Start events you saw in the Live stream when you first set up your input. Other events need to be captured by writing code in your app. Of these, the most significant are:

Screen/Page Views - keep track of where a user is in your app
Custom Events - track any actions the user might take in your app, such as clicking a button or watching a video.
Commerce Events - track purchases and other product-related activity.
User data
mParticle also captures data about your user, including their identities, information about the device they are using and any custom attributes you set. As with event data, some user data, such as information about the devices they use, is captured automatically by mParticle’s native SDKs. Two important types of user data must be captured by writing code in your app:

User identities are unique identifiers for your user, like an email address or customer ID. These are different from the device identities collected automatically by the SDKs, which don’t identify an individual person but a particular cell phone, browser session, or some other device.

User identities help mParticle keep track of unique users of your app and allow you to track a user’s activity over time and across different devices. To learn a lot more about user and device identities, read our IDSync guide. For now, you just need to know that a user identity is a way of identifying a person, independently of the device they are currently using.
User Attributes are key-value pairs that can store any custom data about your user. The value of a user attribute can be:

A string
A number
A list
A boolean value (true or false)
null - attributes with a null value function as ‘tags’, and can be used to sort your users into categories.
Capture User and Event Data
To start capturing data you will need to go back to your app code. In the previous step you should have installed and initialized the mParticle SDK in at least one of your app platforms. This means you’re already set up to capture Session Start and Session End events, as well as basic data about the device. Grab a friendly developer again, if you need one, and try to add some additional user and event data to your implementation. Here are a few things you might try, with links to the appropriate developer docs:

Add a Customer ID or Email Address for a user.
Android / iOS / Web

Create a custom user attribute that tells you something about a user. For example: status: "premium".
Android / iOS / Web

Create a page or screen view event that captures the name of a page or screen being viewed.
Android / iOS / Web

Create a custom event to track a user action in your app. Include some custom attributes. For example, the mPTravel app sends a custom event when a user views one of its content videos. The event is called “Play Video” and it has two custom attributes: the category of content, and the travel destination the video promotes. Later on, you’ll see how events like these can be used to target custom messaging.
Android / iOS / Web

Create a purchase event - track a purchase using mParticle’s commerce APIs.
Android / iOS / Web
Verify: Look for incoming data in the Live Stream
Once you’ve added code to your app to start collecting some basic data, start up a development build of your app again and trigger some events. Have another look at the Live Stream. You should start to see new event batches, with the individual events you have added to your app.



Troubleshoot
If you have at least some data in your Live Stream, such as the session start and session end messages generated in the previous step, but your screen views, custom events or purchases aren’t showing, it’s likely that there is an issue with your app code.

Check that your code is correctly formed, and that the methods which send events to mParticle are actually triggered by user activity in your app.
Review your development environment’s logs. These will show when an event is sent to mParticle.
Next steps
Excellent, you’ve started collecting real custom datapoints from your app. At this point you might want to take a quick break to:

Explore the capabilities of the Live Stream
Learn more about the importance of user identities in mParticle.
Now that you’re collecting data, it’s time to send it on by connecting an event output.

Create an Audience
Prerequisites
Before you start this activity, you should have already:

Created an input
Started to collect some basic data points
Get some more data
Up until this point, you’ve been testing your account with a single development build of your app. This works well to establish basic data throughput.

The Audiences feature allows you to target segments of your users based on their activity or attributes. So to effectively use Audiences, even at the testing stage, your app needs multiple users!

If you’re not ready to enable the mParticle SDKs in your Production app yet, you can either spin up multiple development environments, or try using the Events API to supply some test data in bulk.

Create your Audience
The mPTravel app lets users watch video content about travel destinations. This tutorial creates an audience to allow mPTravel to target users who view content about a paticular destination with deals for that destination.

Create Criteria
To define an audience, you need to specify some selection criteria. Click Add Criteria. 
Choose the type of criteria you want to create. Except for the Users type, which is covered below, these criteria all correspond to mParticle event types. Click Events to target custom events.

There are three distinct aspects of an event criteria that you can define: 

Event name - mParticle populates a dropdown list based on all event names received for the workspace. This means that you can only select events that have already been captured by mParticle. This example targets the “Play Video” event name.
Attributes - you can refine your criteria further by setting attribute conditions. This example targets only instances of the Play Video event where the “category” attribute has a value of “Destination Intro” and the “destination” attribute has a value of “Paris”.

Note that this example creates an Exact Match condition, but there are other types of condition to explore. For example, if you set “destination” Contains “France”, then you could match events with a “destination” of both “Paris, France” and “Cannes, France”.

The types of condition available depend on what kind of data an attribute holds. For example, an attribute that records a number value will have Greater Than and Less Than conditions. mParticle automatically detects what type of data an attribute holds. However, you can manually set the data type by clicking the type symbol.

Don’t change the data type unless you really know what you’re doing. If you force the data type to be Number, and all your attribute values are strings, your condition will always fail! As long as you’re sending the same type of data consistently for each attribute, you shouldn’t have to worry about it.

Recency / Frequency - Sets how many times the user needs to trigger a matching event, and in what time period, in order to meet the condition. If you don’t specify anything here, the default for Recency / Frequency is “Greater than 0 events in the last 30 days”.
When you’re happy with your criteria, click Done.
Add Multiple Criteria
You could save this audience right now and target all users who have watched mPTravel’s Paris content in the past three days. But, what if you have some extra special limited deals that you want to save for your premium members? You can’t just tell everyone! You need to add a second criteria. Whenever you have multiple criteria, you need to decide how to evaluate them together. There are three options:

And - both conditions have to be true for a user to be added to the audience
Or - a user will be added to the audience if either condition is true
Exclude - a user will be added only if the first condition is true, but the second is false. Exclude is great for use cases like abandoned cart targeting. You can select users who triggered an Add to Cart event, then exclude users who triggered a Purchase event.
To target users who watched Paris content, AND are premium members, choose And.



This is a good opportunity to look at the User criteria type, as it’s a little different. Where the other criteria match users who have triggered a particular event, the User criteria looks at all other information you might know about your users: the type of device they use, where they live, their custom user attributes, etc. This example targets users with a user attribute of “status”, with a value of “Premium”.

When you’ve added as many criteria as you need, click Save as Draft to come back to your definition later, or Activate to start calculating.



When you activate the audience, you’ll be asked if you want to set up an A/B Test. Select No for now, to go to the Connections Screen.

Verify your Audience
Check that size is greater than zero
After you finish defining your audience you will be taken straight to the Audience Connection screen. Connecting an audience will be covered in the next section.

First, check that your audience definition is working as expected. Start by selecting Audiences from the left column to go to the main Audiences page. Audiences take time to calculate, so if you’ve only just activated it, you’ll probably see a Size of 0 for your audience. Mouseover the pie chart to see how far along the calculation process is.



After a while, as long as you have users that match your criteria, you should start to see the value of the Size column increase.



If the audience is 100% calculated, and your size is still zero, there may be an issue with your conditions.

Download to verify individual memberships
In some cases, it might be enough just to know that your audience is matching users. However, if you know specific identities of users who should match your criteria, you can check that they matched by downloading your entire audience in CSV form. Follow the instructions here to download your audience.

Troubleshoot
For simple audiences, it’s a good idea to check your Live Stream to see if you can find an event that should match your criteria. Here, you can see a user who has triggered the correct event.



Some things to check:

Make sure you selected the right platforms. If the matching events are all from iOS, and you only selected the Android platform when creating the audience, you won’t match any users.
Examine each of your conditions against your test data from the Live Stream. Matches in the Audience Builder are not case sensitive. If you’ve set attribute conditions, do the attribute values in your test data exactly match the value you’ve provided in your condition?
If you have multiple criteria, make sure your chaining statements are correct. Did you select And when you meant Or?
Remember that recalculating an audience will take some time, so check your criteria thoroughly before you save your changes.

Next steps
Congratulations on making your first audience in mParticle! You will have noticed that mParticle populates your options in the Audience Builder based on the data you have captured. This means that as you add new sources, and send more data, you will unlock new options for building audiences. Check in periodically to make sure that you’re getting the most out of your data. Some mParticle clients create hundreds of audiences, each with dozens of chained criteria to target hyper-specific user segments. You’re only limited by the data you can capture and your imagination.

A few things to read or think about:

The Audience docs in the Platform Guide provide more detail about building criteria and advanced features like A/B Testing, and Audience Sharing.
Audiences are a part of mParticle where the quality and consistency of your data plan become apparent. If your developers name an attribute favorite_color in your Web implementation, and favoriteColor in your Android implementation, it’s going to be much harder to build a cross-platform audience to capture your users who love green. Check out some docs about the importance of names here.
Next up, you will learn how to connect an audience to one of mParticle’s Audience partners.

Connect an Audience Output
To forward data out of mParticle, you must create and connect and audience output.

Prerequisites
Before you start this activity, you should have already created an audience.

How audiences are forwarded
In mParticle, an audience is a set of users who match a given set of criteria. When mParticle prepares to forward an audience, it is broken down into a series of messages about audience membership. Each message contains:

The name of the audience
An identity that can be used for targeting, such as an email address, a device identity or a social media identity.
Whether that identity is being added to, or removed from the audience.
mParticle then translates these messages into a format that can be read by each audience output partner, and forwards them via HTTP API. Each output deals with audience information a little differently, depending on their data structure, but there are two main patterns.

Direct
Some audience output partners allow mParticle to either to directly create an audience (some call them ‘lists’, or ‘segments’) via their API, or at least to manage the membership of an existing audience. The end result will be an ‘audience’ in the partner system, containing as many identities from the original mParticle audience as the output can accept. mParticle will continue to update the membership of the audience in the partner system as users are added and removed. Email marketing and social media platforms are usually in this category.

Indirect
Not all audience output services have a concept of ‘audiences’ that mParticle can map to. Others don’t allow their audiences to be directly managed via API. In these cases, mParticle usually forwards audiences as some kind of user attribute or tag. Push messaging and other mobile-oriented services often fall into this category.

As an example, Braze, has it’s own audience feature, called ‘Segments’, but it does not allow mParticle to create segments via API. Instead, for each Braze-supported identity in the audience, mParticle sets a tag on the user, named after the audience. You can then easily find matching users in Braze by searching for that tag.

The catch here is that it is often necessary for the output service to already have a record of the users you want to target. For this reason, this type of audience integration usually works best when paired with a matching event integration.

Example - Connect an audience to Mailchimp
Just like event outputs, each audience output will follow a similar setup process, with the exact prerequisites and settings being different for each. This tutorial forwards an audience to Mailchimp as an example. You can follow the same steps with a different output, or create a free Mailchimp account to follow along exactly.

Create a Mailchimp List
mParticle sends audiences to Mailchimp via its List API. For this to work, You need to have already created a list in my Mailchimp account, and you need to know the List ID. You can give your Mailchimp list the same name as the mParticle audience you want to forward.

.

You’ll also need to create a Mailchimp API Key, which you can do from the Extras tab of your Mailchimp Account Settings.



Add the Mailchimp output
Navigate to the Directory in the sidebar. Locate Mailchimp and select the Audience option.
Complete the Configuration Settings. You’ll need the API Key you created in Mailchimp. All audience outputs will need different settings. This example sets the Email Type to “HTML” and disables the Double Opt-In and Delete on Subscription End settings.

Click Save.
Connect your Audience
Navigate to Audiences in the left column and open any audience page. This example uses the “Potential Parisians” audience, created in the previous tutorial. Click the Connect tab. 
Click Connect Output. 
Select your Mailchimp configuration and complete the Connection Settings. Again these will be different for every output. For Mailchimp, you just need the List ID of your Mailchimp list. Click Save. 
Verify: Check your list in Mailchimp
The simplest way to check that your Connection is working is to see if your Mailchimp list is showing subscribers. For most audience outputs, mParticle begins forwarding data immediately and continues to update audiences in near real time. For some outputs, however, the design of the output partner’s API requires that we queue audiences messages and upload at a regular interval. In these cases, we make a note of the upload criteria in the docs for that output.

mParticle forwards to Mailchimp in realtime, and you should be start to see results in the mailchimp dashboard within ten minutes.

Open the Lists tab in your Mailchimp dashboard. Find the list you used to set up the connection. If you see a positive subscriber count, your connection is working.



Troubleshoot
If you aren’t seeing your audiences in the output partner’s dashboard, make sure to check any API Keys, Audience IDs and any other settings for correctness.
Many audience outputs are services which allow you to send mass communications or target advertising to wide audiences, so access to the features that mParticle forwards audiences to is often tightly controlled. To be able to view and manage audiences in the output service, you may need to do one or more of the following:

Create a special business or advertising account with the service,
Set up valid billing information,
Create at least one ad campaign,
Record agreement to the services terms and conditions,
Have administrative access in your organizations ad account.
A common question around forwarding audiences is why the size of the audience (or list, or segment) you see in the partner’s dashboard doesn’t match the size of the audience shown in mParticle. This is common, and usually does not mean anything is wrong. When you create an audience in mParticle, we will include as many identities as we have for each user in the audience. However, most outputs only support a small subset of identity types. Here’s a simple example:

The audience ‘Potential Parisians’ matches 100 users in mParticle.
Of these users, 50 have email addresses, and 80 have Android Advertising IDs.
Connect this audience to Mailchimp, which supports only email addresses, and AppNexus, which supports only Device IDs.
You will see 50 users in your Mailchimp list and 80 users in AppNexus.
Next steps
If you’ve followed all of our Getting Started tutorials, you have now:

Created at least one input,
Captured some data about your users, and their actions in your app,
Connected an event output,
Created an audience, and
Forwarded that audience to an audience output.
The final section covers some of the more advanced mParticle features you can use to transform and refine your data.

ransform and Enhance Your Data
If you’ve followed our guide this far, you have a firm grounding in the basics of mParticle. Now you’re ready to use some of our advanced and premium features to transform, enrich and enhance your data. Here are a few suggestions for where you might want to explore next.

Establish your Identity Strategy
This guide has already covered collecting identities, such as email addresses, for your users. mParticle’s IDSync feature gives you a lot of control over how you identify and track your users over time, and selecting an Identity Strategy is one of the most important decisions you need to make when implementing mParticle. Read our full IDSync guide for more.

Add more sources
For most mParticle clients, the primary sources of data are native and web apps, instrumented with the mParticle SDK, but you can also use mParticle to leverage other sources of data to build a more complete picture of your users:

The Events API can be used to send supplementary server-side data.
Our main Apple and Android SDKs can also be instrumented in AppleTV and FireTV apps, and we publish independent SDKs for Roku and Xbox.
If you use a cross-platform development framework, you can use our libraries for React Native, Xamarin, Unity, and Cordova to interface with our native SDKs.
Use Feeds to bring in data from other services.
Explore advanced Audience features
If you want to compare different messaging platforms or strategies, you can use mParticle to conduct an A/B Test by splitting an audience into two or more variations and connecting each to different outputs.
The more specific your audiences, the more you are likely to need to create. If you have a large number of audiences to forward, use Bulk Audience Connections workflow to speed things up.
Transform your Data
One of the core benefits of mParticle is the ability to capture data once and forward it to multiple outputs. However, you probably don’t want to send all your data to every output. mParticle provides you with a full set of tools to filter and transform your data. Use these tools to control the flow of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), to customize the data you send to each output and to control your costs.

The Data Filter allows you to individually filter each data point for each output.
User Splits allow you to test competing services by dividing your users into groups and connecting each group to different outputs.
Forwarding Rules allow you to block data to an output according to simple predefined rules.
User Sampling allows you to send only a subset of your data to a given output. This is usually done to control costs for services that charge according to data volume or unique user counts.
For advanced transformations, the Rules feature allows you to host a custom function on AWS Lambda which can change almost any aspect of your data.
Manage your GDPR Obligations
If you have users in the European Union, you may have obligations as a Data Controller under the General Data Processing Regulation. mParticle provides tools, available as premium features, to help you manage two aspects of GDPR compliance:

User Consent
Data Subject Requests
Know your limits
Part of the purpose of mParticle is to allow you to maximize leverage of your data without compromising performance. In order to protect the performance of both your app and the mParticle dashboard, we impose certain limits on the data you can send. If you’re a dashboard user, you can read a brief summary of the default limits, here. If you need the full picture, you can read our detailed guide.

It seems like you're asking for insights or information derived from the Lytics documentation at docs.lytics.com to support a big data project. Since your request is broad and you’ve mentioned a project without specifying details, I’ll provide a comprehensive breakdown of how Lytics relates to big data, based on the documentation, and offer actionable insights you can adapt for your project. I’ll aim for around 1000 words, focusing on big data concepts like data collection, processing, storage, and activation, all of which Lytics emphasizes as a Customer Data Platform (CDP). If you have a more specific focus for your project, feel free to clarify, and I’ll tailor it further!

Lytics and Big Data: A Foundation for Your Project
Big data refers to the massive volume, velocity, and variety of data that traditional systems struggle to handle, requiring advanced tools for storage, processing, and analysis. Lytics, as a CDP, is built to manage these characteristics in the context of customer data, making it a valuable case study for a big data project. Below, I’ll explore how Lytics aligns with big data principles and provide ideas you can leverage.

1. Data Collection: Handling Volume and Variety
Big data projects thrive on collecting vast amounts of data from diverse sources. Lytics excels here by aggregating customer data from websites, mobile apps, CRM systems, marketing channels, and more. The documentation highlights the Lytics JavaScript Tag as a primary tool for real-time data collection from websites. This tag captures user interactions like page views, clicks, and custom events, feeding them into Lytics to build unified customer profiles.

Project Idea: For your project, you could design a system to collect large-scale user interaction data from multiple sources (e.g., web, IoT devices, or social media). Mimic Lytics by implementing a lightweight tracking script or API that streams data into a central repository. Consider using tools like Apache Kafka for high-throughput data ingestion, simulating the real-time collection Lytics achieves.
Big Data Relevance: The volume of interactions (e.g., millions of page views daily) and variety (structured data like timestamps, unstructured like user comments) align with big data’s core traits.
Lytics also supports custom data ingestion via CSV uploads, SFTP, or APIs, allowing businesses to import historical or third-party data. This flexibility is crucial for big data systems needing to integrate legacy datasets with live streams.

Actionable Tip: Incorporate a hybrid ingestion pipeline in your project—combine real-time streams with batch uploads. Use a schema-agnostic storage system like Google BigQuery (which Lytics integrates with) to handle structured and semi-structured data seamlessly.
2. Data Processing: Velocity and Real-Time Insights
Velocity—the speed at which data is processed—is a hallmark of big data. Lytics processes data in real time, using its Content Affinity Engine to analyze user behavior and content interactions instantly. This engine employs machine learning to identify topics and calculate user affinities, enabling immediate personalization.

Project Idea: Build a real-time analytics module for your project. For example, process streaming user data to detect patterns (e.g., purchase intent) using a framework like Apache Spark or Flink. Emulate Lytics’ affinity scoring by applying clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to group users by behavior, then use these insights for dynamic outputs like recommendations.
Big Data Relevance: Real-time processing handles high-velocity data, a key challenge in big data systems where latency can degrade user experience.
The documentation also mentions the Lytics Dev Tools Chrome Extension for validating data collection, ensuring accuracy at high speeds. This suggests a focus on data quality, which is critical when processing massive datasets.

Actionable Tip: Include a validation layer in your project—perhaps a dashboard that monitors data integrity (e.g., missing values, duplicates) as it flows through your pipeline. Tools like Apache NiFi could help manage and clean data on the fly.
3. Data Storage: Scalability and Integration
Big data requires scalable storage solutions. Lytics leverages Google Cloud BigQuery as its data warehouse, a fully managed, petabyte-scale platform ideal for big data projects. The documentation notes integrations with BigQuery for storing and analyzing customer data, allowing businesses to query vast datasets without infrastructure overhead.

Project Idea: Design a scalable storage layer for your project using a cloud data warehouse like BigQuery, Snowflake, or Amazon Redshift. Store raw event data (e.g., user clicks, transactions) and processed profiles (e.g., segmented users) separately, optimizing for both analytics and activation. Replicate Lytics’ approach by linking your storage to a processing engine for real-time queries.
Big Data Relevance: Scalability ensures your system can handle growing data volumes, a non-negotiable in big data applications.
Lytics’ composable architecture also stands out—it integrates with existing data warehouses rather than forcing a standalone solution. This modularity reduces duplication and leverages investments in tools like Google Cloud.

Actionable Tip: Make your project modular. Allow it to plug into external storage systems via APIs or reverse ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), mirroring Lytics’ flexibility. This could involve exporting processed data to a third-party tool like Tableau for visualization.
4. Data Activation: Turning Insights into Action
Big data isn’t just about collection and storage—it’s about actionable outcomes. Lytics activates data through personalization SDKs and APIs, enabling real-time delivery of tailored content, such as website messages or product recommendations. The documentation emphasizes use cases like converting unknown users to known ones or suppressing ad spend on engaged users, directly impacting ROI.

Project Idea: Create an activation component for your project. For instance, use processed data to trigger personalized notifications or ads via a REST API. If your project involves e-commerce, recommend products based on user clusters identified earlier, deploying them through a mock storefront or email system.
Big Data Relevance: Activation leverages the value of big data, transforming raw information into business results—a key metric of success.
Lytics’ Shopify integration exemplifies this, importing customer and order data to fuel segmented marketing. This shows how big data can bridge operational systems (e.g., e-commerce platforms) with analytical ones.

Actionable Tip: Integrate your project with a practical application—say, a mock CRM or marketing tool. Use webhooks or an event-driven architecture (e.g., AWS Lambda) to push insights to end users, simulating Lytics’ ecosystem approach.
5. Advanced Features: Machine Learning and Privacy
Lytics uses machine learning for segmentation and affinity modeling, a big data staple for extracting insights from complex datasets. The Content Affinity Engine and predictive behavior tools highlight how AI enhances personalization at scale.

Project Idea: Incorporate a machine learning model into your project. Train a model (e.g., using TensorFlow or PyTorch) on user data to predict behaviors like churn or purchase likelihood. Deploy it within your pipeline for continuous learning, akin to Lytics’ adaptive approach.
Big Data Relevance: Machine learning handles the variety and complexity of big data, uncovering patterns humans might miss.
Privacy is another big data concern, and Lytics addresses it with GDPR/CCPA-compliant deployments and data clean rooms via BigQuery. This ensures sensitive data (e.g., PII) is protected while still usable.

Actionable Tip: Build privacy controls into your project—hash sensitive fields (e.g., emails) and implement role-based access. Explore a data clean room concept using SQL views to share aggregated insights without exposing raw data.
Project Framework Suggestion
Here’s a high-level framework for your big data project inspired by Lytics:

Ingestion Layer: Use Kafka or a custom script to collect data from web and API sources.
Processing Layer: Process streams with Spark or Flink, applying ML for segmentation.
Storage Layer: Store in BigQuery or a similar warehouse, with separate tables for raw and processed data.
Activation Layer: Build an API to serve insights (e.g., recommendations) to a front-end app.
Validation Layer: Add a monitoring tool (e.g., Grafana) to track data quality and performance.
Conclusion
Lytics demonstrates how big data principles—volume, velocity, variety, and value—can be applied to customer-centric use cases. For your project, focus on scalability, real-time processing, and actionable outputs, using Lytics as a blueprint. Whether you’re analyzing user behavior, optimizing marketing, or building a prototype CDP, these insights provide a solid starting point. If you share more about your project’s goals (e.g., industry, dataset, or tools), I can refine this further!
20 web pages
It seems like you’re asking for a detailed, 3000-word exploration of the creation process for a big data project, drawing from the documentation of four Customer Data Platforms (CDPs): Segment (segment.com/docs), mParticle (docs.mparticle.com), Lytics (docs.lytics.com), and Zeotap (docs.zeotap.com). Since your previous request focused on Lytics and big data, I’ll assume you want a deep dive into how these platforms inform the creation process of a big data system—covering planning, data collection, processing, storage, activation, and optimization. I’ll structure this as a comprehensive guide, integrating insights from each CDP’s documentation to provide a practical, actionable framework for your project. If you meant something different by "3000 thousand paragraph word," please clarify, and I’ll adjust accordingly!

Crafting a Big Data Project: A 3000-Word Creation Process Inspired by Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap
Building a big data project is a complex endeavor requiring careful planning, robust technical implementation, and continuous optimization. Customer Data Platforms like Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap offer valuable blueprints through their documentation, showcasing how to handle massive datasets, process them in real time, and activate insights for business value. This 3000-word guide walks through the creation process for a big data system, leveraging lessons from these platforms to help you design, develop, and deploy your project effectively.

Phase 1: Planning and Architecture Design
The creation process begins with a clear plan, defining goals, scope, and architecture. Segment’s documentation emphasizes simplicity and modularity, suggesting a pipeline where data flows from sources (e.g., websites, apps) to destinations (e.g., analytics tools) via a central hub. Their Sources Overview highlights creating a source for each unique data origin, using a write key to streamline ingestion. For your project, start by identifying data sources—web interactions, IoT devices, or CRM systems—and mapping how they’ll connect to your system.

mParticle takes a similar but more identity-focused approach, as seen in its Identity Guide. It stresses unifying user data across platforms using identifiers like userId or deviceId, crucial for big data projects tracking individuals across touchpoints. Plan your architecture to include an identity resolution layer, ensuring data from disparate sources links to a single user profile.

Lytics, per its Developer Quickstart, prioritizes personalization, suggesting a system that not only collects data but also builds actionable user profiles. For your project, define use cases—e.g., personalized marketing or predictive analytics—and design your architecture to support these outcomes, perhaps with a machine learning component.

Zeotap’s Documentation Home underscores scalability and compliance (e.g., GDPR), recommending a flexible, cloud-native design. For your project, sketch a cloud-based architecture (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) with scalability in mind, incorporating privacy controls like data anonymization from the start. Combine these insights: create a modular, scalable system with clear source-to-destination flows, identity resolution, personalization goals, and compliance baked in.

Phase 2: Data Collection and Ingestion
Data collection is the backbone of big data, requiring robust mechanisms to handle volume, variety, and velocity. Segment’s JavaScript Source offers a lightweight approach: embed a script to capture events (e.g., track, identify) in real time. For your project, implement a similar client-side tracker—perhaps using JavaScript or a mobile SDK—to collect user interactions like clicks or purchases. Segment’s write key system simplifies routing, so consider a unique identifier for each data stream.

mParticle’s Events API provides a server-side alternative, supporting custom events and commerce-specific structures (e.g., purchases). This is ideal for high-volume or sensitive data. For your project, build a dual ingestion system: client-side for web/mobile, server-side for backend systems (e.g., via HTTP POST to an endpoint). Use mParticle’s structured event types as inspiration to categorize data (e.g., navigation, transactions).

Lytics’ JavaScript Tag Config extends collection to include custom events and content metadata, feeding its Content Affinity Engine. For your project, enhance your ingestion with metadata extraction—say, tagging page content or product details—to enrich downstream analysis. Deploy a tag like Lytics’ to capture both user actions and context.

Zeotap’s Server-to-Server HTTP API focuses on batch and real-time ingestion from external sources (e.g., CRMs). For your project, add a batch pipeline using SFTP or APIs to import historical data, complementing real-time streams. Integrate these approaches: use a mix of client-side tags, server-side APIs, and batch uploads, ensuring your system handles diverse data types at scale.

Phase 3: Data Processing and Transformation
Processing turns raw data into usable insights, a critical step in big data. Segment’s Transformations allow filtering or enriching events before they reach destinations. For your project, design a processing layer—perhaps with Apache Spark—to clean data (e.g., remove duplicates), enrich it (e.g., add geolocation), and transform it into a standardized format. Segment’s simplicity suggests keeping this lightweight yet flexible.

mParticle’s Data Master emphasizes real-time processing and identity resolution, mapping events to user profiles instantly. For your project, implement a stream processor (e.g., Apache Flink) to merge events with user identities in real time, using a key-value store like Redis for fast lookups. Add logic to handle identify calls, as mParticle does, linking anonymous to known users.

Lytics’ Content Affinity Engine processes data with machine learning, scoring user interests based on behavior. For your project, integrate an ML model (e.g., via TensorFlow) to analyze patterns—say, clustering users by purchase history. Process data in near real time to support dynamic use cases like recommendations.

Zeotap’s Data Orchestration focuses on preparing data for activation, ensuring it’s segmented and enriched. For your project, build a transformation pipeline that segments users (e.g., high-value customers) and enriches profiles with external data (e.g., demographics). Combine these: create a hybrid processing system—real-time for speed, batch for depth—with ML-driven insights and identity resolution.

Phase 4: Data Storage and Management

Comparing Audience Creation Across Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap
Audience creation is a cornerstone of big data projects, enabling businesses to segment users into actionable groups for marketing, analytics, or personalization. Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap each offer distinct approaches to this "one-to-many" process—taking a single pool of customer data and producing multiple audience segments tailored to specific goals. Below, I’ll compare their methods, tools, strengths, and differences, focusing on how they transform raw data into diverse, usable audiences.

1. Segment: Audience Creation via Destinations and Protocols
Approach: Segment’s audience creation is indirect but highly flexible, relying on its role as a data pipeline rather than a native segmentation engine. Per the Segment Audiences documentation, audiences are defined using Segment Protocols, a feature that tracks events and traits to build segments (e.g., "Users who viewed a product page"). These audiences are then synced to downstream Destinations (e.g., Google Ads, Braze) where the actual segmentation logic often resides.

Process: Collect events via sources (e.g., JavaScript SDK’s track calls), define audience rules in Protocols (e.g., event = 'Product Viewed'), and push to tools that create and activate segments. The Connections Destinations page lists over 300 integrations, allowing one dataset to feed many audience types.
One-to-Many: Segment’s strength is its ability to distribute a single data stream to multiple destinations, each applying its own segmentation logic. For example, one set of user events could create a "high-value customer" segment in Salesforce and a "cart abandoner" segment in Klaviyo simultaneously.
Tools: JavaScript SDK, Protocols UI, Destination APIs, real-time sync via Functions.
Strengths: Simplicity and modularity—Segment doesn’t build audiences itself but enables many tools to do so, avoiding lock-in. Real-time event streaming supports dynamic segmentation.
Weaknesses: Lacks native, in-platform audience management; relies on external tools for complex logic, which can fragment control.
Project Insight: For your project, adopt Segment’s approach if you need a lightweight, hub-and-spoke model. Collect data once, then use APIs to send it to multiple segmentation engines (e.g., a custom ML model or third-party platforms), creating diverse audiences without building everything in-house.

2. mParticle: Audience Creation with Real-Time Cohorts
Approach: mParticle’s audience creation is robust and centralized, focusing on real-time cohort building tied to identity resolution. The Audience Guide details how users are grouped based on events, attributes, and behaviors, with segments synced to downstream partners instantly or in batches.

Weaknesses: Heavier reliance on mParticle’s ecosystem; less flexibility than Segment for custom destinations without pre-built integrations.
Project Insight: Use mParticle’s model if your project needs centralized audience creation with real-time precision. Build a segmentation engine using a stream processor (e.g., Flink) and a UI for defining rules, syncing outputs to multiple endpoints via webhooks or APIs.

3. Lytics: Audience Creation with Behavioral Personalization
Approach: Lytics takes a behavior-driven, AI-powered approach to audience creation, as outlined in its Building Profiles and Content Affinity docs. It builds rich user profiles from web data, then segments them using machine learning and affinity scoring.

Process: The JavaScript Tag collects behavioral data (e.g., page views, clicks), which Lytics processes to create profiles with attributes and affinities (e.g., interest in “tech gadgets”). Audiences are defined via the Lytics UI or APIs (e.g., “Users with high affinity for sports content”) and activated through Personalization SDKs or integrations like Shopify.
One-to-Many: Lytics generates multiple segments from one dataset by analyzing behavior patterns. A single user pool might produce "engaged visitors," "potential churners," and "content enthusiasts," each tailored for personalization or marketing.
Tools: JavaScript Tag, Content Affinity Engine, Lytics Dev Tools Chrome Extension, SDKs/APIs.
Strengths: Deep behavioral insights and ML-driven segmentation create highly specific audiences. Real-time personalization (e.g., via Shopify integration) enhances "one-to-many" utility.
Weaknesses: Focus on personalization may limit broader analytics use cases; requires more setup (e.g., tag configuration) than Segment or mParticle.
Project Insight: For your project, emulate Lytics if personalization is key. Integrate an ML model (e.g., clustering with Scikit-learn) to segment users by behavior, then use an API to deliver tailored audiences to multiple channels, like websites or ad platforms.

4. Zeotap: Audience Creation with Scalable Orchestration
Approach: Zeotap’s audience creation is enterprise-grade, focusing on scalability and cross-channel activation, as seen in its Data Orchestration docs. It aggregates data from multiple sources, builds segments, and distributes them across MarTech/AdTech ecosystems.

I’ll cover its architecture, tools, use cases, and implications, ensuring a thorough understanding for your big data endeavors.

Introduction to Segment (~300 Words)
Segment’s core promise is to “collect once, use everywhere.” Unlike CDPs that focus on native segmentation or personalization, Segment acts as a data pipeline, gathering customer data from diverse sources—websites, mobile apps, servers—and routing it to hundreds of destinations (e.g., analytics platforms, marketing tools) where audiences are defined and activated. The Segment Overview positions it as a middleware layer, reducing integration complexity and ensuring data consistency. For audience creation, this modularity is its standout feature: a single dataset can fuel countless segments across multiple tools, embodying a "one-to-many" approach critical for big data applications.

This flexibility makes Segment ideal for businesses and developers handling large-scale, varied data. Its documentation is a treasure trove of technical guidance, from Sources to Destinations, offering a blueprint for building robust data systems. For your project, Segment’s approach provides a model for efficient data management, enabling you to focus on insights rather than infrastructure.

Phase 1: Data Collection – The Foundation of Audience Creation (~1000 Words)
Key Feature: Unified Data Ingestion

Segment’s audience creation begins with data collection, the bedrock of any big data system. The Sources Overview details how Segment captures data from over 300 sources, including websites, mobile apps, servers, and cloud apps (e.g., CRMs). The most critical component here is the JavaScript Source, a lightweight script that tracks user interactions in real time.

How It Works: After adding the JavaScript snippet to your site (via <script> tag or tag manager), Segment’s analytics.js library initializes with a unique write key—a secure identifier tying data to your account. Events are captured using methods like analytics.track('Product Viewed'), analytics.identify('user123'), or analytics.page(), sending payloads (e.g., { event: 'Purchase', properties: { amount: 50 } }) to Segment’s servers via HTTP POST.
Significance: This unified ingestion ensures all user actions—clicks, purchases, sign-ups—are collected consistently, forming a single dataset. The Tracking Plans feature enforces schema consistency (e.g., required fields like userId), crucial for downstream reliability.
Mobile and Server-Side Options:

Beyond web, Segment’s Mobile SDKs (iOS, Android) and Server Sources extend collection to apps and backend systems. For example, the HTTP API lets you send batch or real-time events from servers, ideal for high-volume or sensitive data (e.g., payment transactions). This versatility ensures your project can handle diverse inputs—web clicks, app swipes, or server logs—into one cohesive stream.

Why It Matters for Audience Creation:

In a "one-to-many" context, this single, standardized dataset is gold. One pool of events (e.g., 10 million daily interactions) can be routed to multiple tools, each slicing it into unique audiences. For instance, a track event for “Product Added” could inform a “cart abandoner” segment in Braze and a “high-intent” group in Google Ads, all from the same data point. The Debugger tool ensures collection accuracy, logging events in real time to catch issues like missing properties—vital for big data quality.

Project Application:

For your project, build a multi-source ingestion layer inspired by Segment. Use a JavaScript tracker for web (e.g., a custom script), a mobile SDK (e.g., via Firebase), and an HTTP endpoint for server data. Assign unique keys to each source, stream events into a queue (e.g., Kafka), and enforce a schema to ensure downstream compatibility. This mirrors Segment’s ability to feed one dataset into many audience definitions.

Phase 2: Data Routing – The "One-to-Many" Engine (~1000 Words)
Key Feature: Destination Ecosystem

Segment’s most critical audience creation mechanism is its routing capability, detailed in Connections Destinations. With over 300 integrations—analytics (Mixpanel), advertising (Google Ads), marketing (Mailchimp), and warehouses (BigQuery)—Segment distributes data to tools where audiences are crafted and activated.

How It Works: Once collected, events are processed by Segment’s servers and routed to enabled destinations via APIs or webhooks. The Destination Catalog outlines each integration’s setup—e.g., connecting Google Analytics requires an API key, while Braze needs an app key. Events flow in real time (sub-second latency) or batches, depending on the destination’s specs. The Functions feature lets you customize routing with JavaScript or Node.js (e.g., if (event.amount > 100) { sendTo('HighValueTool') }).
Significance: This is Segment’s "one-to-many" superpower. One event stream feeds multiple endpoints, each applying its own segmentation logic. For example, a Purchase event could trigger a “loyal customer” segment in Salesforce, a “revenue tracker” in Amplitude, and a “retargeting list” in Facebook Ads—all without redundant collection.
Real-Time vs. Batch:

Segment supports both real-time streaming (e.g., for ad platforms needing instant updates) and batch exports (e.g., to warehouses like Redshift), as noted in Warehouses. This dual approach ensures flexibility—real-time for dynamic audiences, batch for deep analytics—critical for big data’s velocity and volume demands.

Why It Matters for Audience Creation:

This routing eliminates silos, a common big data pitfall. Instead of building separate pipelines for each tool, Segment centralizes ingestion and decentralizes activation, saving resources and ensuring consistency. The Transformations feature enhances this by filtering or enriching data before routing (e.g., stripping PII for compliance), tailoring it to each destination’s needs.

Project Application:

Emulate this by designing a routing layer for your project. Stream events from your ingestion queue (e.g., Kafka) to multiple endpoints—say, a real-time API for a dashboard, a batch process for a warehouse, and a webhook for a marketing tool. Use a rules engine (e.g., Apache NiFi) to customize data flow, enabling one dataset to support diverse audience definitions across your system.

Phase 3: Audience Definition – Protocols as the Bridge (~1000 Words)
Key Feature: Segment Protocols

Segment’s audience creation isn’t as centralized as mParticle or Lytics—it delegates heavy segmentation to destinations—but Segment Audiences via Protocols provides a lightweight, pivotal bridge. Protocols let you define audience rules within Segment before data reaches destinations.

How It Works: In the Segment UI, you create audiences based on events, traits, or computed properties (e.g., “Users who triggered ‘Signup’ in the last 7 days”). These rules generate cohorts, which are synced to destinations like Braze or HubSpot via Audience Sync. For example, event = 'Product Viewed' AND properties.category = 'Electronics' could define “tech browsers,” pushed to an ad platform.
Significance: Protocols add a layer of control, filtering or grouping users before downstream tools process them. This isn’t as deep as Lytics’ ML or mParticle’s UI but ensures basic "one-to-many" segmentation within Segment’s ecosystem.
Computed Traits and Event Counting:

Protocols also include Computed Traits, aggregating data like “total purchases” or “last login date” across events. This pre-processes data for destinations, enhancing audience granularity—e.g., “Users with >5 logins” becomes a segment in Mixpanel.

Why It Matters for Audience Creation:

While not Segment’s primary focus, Protocols enable a hybrid approach—some segmentation in-house, more in destinations. This balances simplicity with utility, letting one dataset spawn initial cohorts (e.g., “active users,” “inactive users”) that destinations refine further (e.g., “active users in CA” via Braze). The Real-Time Audiences feature ensures low-latency sync, vital for time-sensitive campaigns.

Project Application:

For your project, build a lightweight segmentation layer inspired by Protocols. Use a stream processor (e.g., Spark Streaming) to define basic rules (e.g., “events > 10”) and compute aggregates (e.g., total spend), then pass these cohorts to downstream systems for deeper analysis. This keeps your core system lean while supporting multiple audience types.

Phase 4: Activation – Turning Data into Action (~1000 Words)
Key Feature: Seamless Destination Activation

Segment’s audience activation shines through its destination integrations, detailed in Destination Actions. Once audiences are defined (via Protocols or destinations), Segment pushes them to tools for execution—ads, emails, analytics dashboards—making data actionable.

How It Works: For example, a “cart abandoner” audience syncs to Braze via API, triggering an email campaign. The Google Ads Destination adds users to remarketing lists, while BigQuery stores events for SQL-based segmentation. Real-time sync ensures immediate action, while batch sync supports heavy lifting (e.g., nightly warehouse updates).
Significance: This seamless handoff is Segment’s activation strength. One dataset, routed to many tools, becomes multiple activated audiences—e.g., “new subscribers” emailed via Mailchimp, “high spenders” targeted on Facebook, “churn risks” flagged in Tableau.
Customization with Functions:

The Functions tool lets you tweak data mid-flight—e.g., enriching events with geolocation before hitting a destination. This ensures audiences are precisely tailored, enhancing their utility across use cases.

Why It Matters for Audience Creation:

Activation closes the "one-to-many" loop. Segment’s ability to distribute one dataset to diverse endpoints—each activating audiences differently—maximizes ROI in big data projects. The Personas feature (now part of Protocols) historically unified identities for activation, though it’s less emphasized today.

Project Application:

Create an activation layer for your project. Build APIs or webhooks to push segmented data to endpoints—e.g., a mock ad platform, a notification system, a warehouse. Use a function-like processor (e.g., Lambda) to customize outputs, ensuring one dataset drives multiple, actionable audience outcomes.

Phase 5: Optimization and Scalability – Keeping It Running (~700 Words)
Key Feature: Monitoring and Scalability

Segment’s audience creation process thrives on optimization, supported by tools like the Debugger and Warehouses. These ensure data quality and system scalability, critical for big data longevity.

How It Works: The Debugger logs events in real time, flagging issues (e.g., malformed payloads), while Event Delivery metrics track success rates to destinations. Warehouses scale storage to petabytes, syncing data hourly or daily for deep analysis.
Significance: Quality data fuels accurate audiences, and scalability handles growing volumes—e.g., millions of events daily routed to 50+ destinations without breaking.
Why It Matters for Audience Creation:

Optimization ensures the "one-to-many" pipeline remains reliable. A single dataset spawning dozens of audiences needs constant validation (e.g., via Inspector) and infrastructure that grows with demand, avoiding bottlenecks.

Project Application:

Add a monitoring dashboard (e.g., Grafana) to your project, tracking ingestion, routing, and activation metrics. Use a scalable warehouse (e.g., BigQuery) for storage, ensuring your system supports increasing audience variety and volume over time.

Introduction to mParticle (~300 Words)
mParticle’s mission is to “make customer data more accessible and actionable.” Unlike Segment’s distributed approach, mParticle centralizes audience creation, offering a robust platform to collect data, unify user identities, define segments, and sync them to over 100 integrations. The Platform Overview positions it as a single source of truth for customer data, ideal for businesses needing real-time insights and precise targeting. For audience creation, its standout feature is the ability to transform one dataset into multiple, dynamic cohorts with minimal latency—a "one-to-many" capability critical for big data applications.

This centralized, identity-driven design makes mParticle a powerful tool for developers and marketers handling complex, multi-channel data. Its documentation provides detailed guidance, from Events API to Audience Guide, offering a roadmap for building sophisticated data systems. For your project, mParticle’s approach provides a model for creating precise, actionable audiences at scale, balancing technical depth with operational efficiency.

Phase 1: Data Collection – Building the Single Source of Truth (~1000 Words)
Key Feature: Comprehensive Event Ingestion

mParticle’s audience creation begins with robust data collection, a cornerstone of big data systems. The Events API and SDKs Overview detail how mParticle captures data from web, mobile apps, servers, and cloud sources (e.g., CRMs), creating a unified dataset.

How It Works: The Web SDK embeds a JavaScript snippet (e.g., <script src="mParticle.js">) to track events like logEvent('Purchase', { product_id: '123' }). Mobile SDKs (iOS, Android) handle app interactions, while the Server-to-Server HTTP API supports backend events (e.g., POST { "event_type": "commerce_event", "data": { "total_amount": 50 } }). Each event ties to a user via identifiers like userId or deviceId.
Significance: This multi-channel ingestion ensures all touchpoints—web clicks, app opens, server logs—feed into one dataset. The Event Types include structured formats (e.g., commerce, custom, screen views), enhancing downstream segmentation with rich, standardized data.
Commerce and Custom Events:

mParticle excels with commerce-specific events (e.g., purchase, add_to_cart), detailed in Commerce Events, critical for e-commerce projects. Custom events allow flexibility—e.g., logEvent('QuizCompleted')—ensuring your project can capture unique interactions. The Batching feature optimizes performance, sending events in groups (e.g., 100 events per request), balancing speed and scale.

Why It Matters for Audience Creation:

In a "one-to-many" context, this unified dataset is the foundation. One stream of events (e.g., 5 million daily interactions) can spawn multiple audiences—say, “frequent buyers,” “app users,” or “cart abandoners”—based on rich event properties. The Data Planning tool enforces schemas (e.g., required fields), ensuring quality and consistency, vital for big data reliability.

Project Application:

For your project, build a multi-channel ingestion system inspired by mParticle. Deploy a Web SDK (e.g., custom JavaScript), mobile SDK (e.g., via Firebase), and HTTP endpoint for server data. Use structured event types (e.g., commerce, navigation) and batching (e.g., with Kafka) to handle high volumes, creating a single, rich dataset feeding multiple audience definitions.

Phase 2: Identity Resolution – Unifying the User (~1000 Words)
Key Feature: Identity Management

mParticle’s most critical contribution to audience creation is its identity resolution, detailed in the Identity Guide. It unifies user data across devices and channels into a single profile, ensuring accurate segmentation.

How It Works: The Identity API links events to identities (e.g., customerId, email, deviceId) via calls like identify or login. For example, a web track event with deviceId merges with an app event using userId if mapped correctly. The IDSync process handles real-time identity updates, resolving anonymous-to-known transitions (e.g., post-signup).
Significance: This ensures one user isn’t split across segments—e.g., a browser visitor and app user become one profile. The User Profiles in Data Master aggregate attributes (e.g., total spend, last login), forming a 360-degree view.
Real-Time and Cross-Channel:

mParticle resolves identities in real time (sub-second latency), critical for dynamic audiences. The Cross-Platform Identity feature links web, mobile, and server data, ensuring a single dataset reflects all touchpoints—e.g., a user browsing on web, buying on app, and contacting support via server.

Why It Matters for Audience Creation:

Identity resolution powers "one-to-many" segmentation. One unified profile (e.g., “Jane Doe, 5 purchases, last active yesterday”) can join multiple cohorts—“loyal customers,” “recent buyers,” “mobile users”—without duplication. This precision is essential for big data projects where fragmented identities skew results, especially in multi-channel environments.

Project Application:

Implement an identity resolution layer in your project. Use a key-value store (e.g., Redis) to map identifiers (e.g., deviceId to userId) in real time, merging events into unified profiles with a stream processor (e.g., Flink). This ensures one dataset supports diverse, accurate audience segments.

Phase 3: Audience Segmentation – Real-Time Cohort Building (~1000 Words)
Key Feature: Native Audience Engine

mParticle’s audience creation shines with its centralized, real-time segmentation, outlined in the Audience Guide. Unlike Segment’s delegation, mParticle builds cohorts directly within its platform.

How It Works: In the Audience UI, you define rules—e.g., “Users who triggered ‘Purchase’ >$100 in 30 days” or “Inactive for 60 days.” These leverage events, attributes, and behaviors from Data Master. Audiences update in real time (500ms latency, per docs), reflecting new data instantly—e.g., a user buying now joins “recent buyers” immediately.
Significance: This native engine combines speed and control. The Calculated Attributes feature computes metrics (e.g., lifetime value) on the fly, enhancing segment granularity—e.g., “Users with LTV >$500.”
Behavioral and Commerce Focus:

mParticle’s strength is behavioral segmentation—e.g., “frequent app users” based on session counts—or commerce-driven cohorts like “cart abandoners” using Commerce Events. This depth ensures one dataset yields diverse, actionable segments.

Why It Matters for Audience Creation:

In a "one-to-many" context, mParticle’s real-time cohort engine is a game-changer. One dataset (e.g., 10 million users) becomes multiple audiences—“high spenders,” “lapsed users,” “new signups”—with precision and immediacy. This reduces reliance on external tools, streamlining big data workflows where timing drives value.

Project Application:

Build a real-time segmentation engine for your project. Use a stream processor (e.g., Spark Streaming) and UI (e.g., a Flask app) to define rules, computing attributes (e.g., total events) on the fly. This centralizes "one-to-many" audience creation, mirroring mParticle’s efficiency and precision.

Phase 4: Activation – Syncing Cohorts to Action (~1000 Words)
Key Feature: Audience Connections

mParticle’s activation process, detailed in Audience Connections, syncs audiences to over 100 integrations—e.g., Facebook Ads, Mailchimp, Salesforce—making them actionable.

How It Works: Once defined, audiences sync via APIs or SDKs in real time or batches. For example, “recent buyers” push to Google Ads for retargeting, while “inactive users” trigger an email in Braze. The Connection Settings let you customize syncs—e.g., sending userId only or throttling frequency.
Significance: This seamless activation turns one dataset into multiple outcomes—ads, emails, CRM updates—across channels. The Real-Time Forwarding ensures sub-second delivery, ideal for time-sensitive use cases like flash sales.
Commerce and Personalization:

mParticle’s commerce focus shines here—e.g., syncing “product browsers” to Shopify for personalized offers. The Data Filters feature refines outputs (e.g., excluding PII), ensuring compliance and relevance.

Why It Matters for Audience Creation:

Activation completes the "one-to-many" pipeline. One dataset spawns diverse cohorts, each activated differently—e.g., “loyalists” to CRM, “abandoners” to ads—maximizing ROI in big data projects. This centralized sync contrasts with Segment’s delegation, offering tighter control.

Project Application:

Create an activation layer for your project. Use webhooks or APIs to push segments to endpoints—e.g., a mock ad platform, email system, or CRM. Add filters (e.g., with Python) to customize outputs, ensuring one dataset drives multiple, tailored actions.

Phase 5: Optimization – Ensuring Precision and Scale (~700 Words)
Key Feature: Data Quality and Scalability

mParticle’s optimization tools, like Data Master Validation and Warehouse Sync, ensure audience creation remains accurate and scalable.

How It Works: Data Master validates incoming events against schemas, flagging errors (e.g., missing product_id). The Live Stream monitors real-time data flow, while Warehouse Integration exports to BigQuery or Snowflake for deep analysis, scaling to billions of events.
Significance: Quality data drives precise audiences, and scalability handles growing volumes—e.g., syncing 50 cohorts daily across 20 integrations without lag.
Why It Matters for Audience Creation:

Optimization sustains the "one-to-many" process. Accurate, scalable data ensures cohorts remain reliable as your project grows, avoiding garbage-in, garbage-out scenarios common in big data.

Project Application:

Add a validation layer (e.g., schema checks in Python) and monitoring dashboard (e.g., Grafana) to your project. Export to a warehouse (e.g., BigQuery) for scalability, ensuring your "one-to-many" audience system thrives long-term.
